  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE<br /> <span class='large'>TO THE FIRST AMERICAN EDITION (PUBLISHED BY WILEY &amp; PUTNAM IN 1845).</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>You have here, my good friends, sundry
moral and entertaining stories, invented
by the monks of old, and used by them for
amusement, as well as for instruction; from
which the most celebrated poets, of our own
and other lands, have condescended to draw
their plots.</p>

<p class='c007'>The improvements and refinements of this
age will naturally lead you to condemn as
absurdities, many of the incidents with which
these tales abound. Considering the knowledge
of the present day, you are justified in so doing.
But I pray you to bear in mind that few qualities
are more dependent on time, than probability
and improbability. When you read these
tales, you must, for the time, retrace your steps
to the age in which they were written; and
though the tale may seem absurd to us of this
day, yet if it was calculated to impress the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>minds of those for whom it was invented, and
to whom it was told, its merit was great, and
therefore deserving of due praise. A giant or
a magician was as probable to the people of the
middle ages, as electricity to us. I pray you
bear this in mind whilst you judge of these
tales.</p>

<p class='c007'>Romantic fiction pleases all minds, both old
and young: the reason is this, says an old
Platonist, “that here things are set down as
they should be; but in the true history of the
world, things are recorded indeed as they are,
but it is but a testimony that they have not
been as they should be. Wherefore, in the
upshot of all, when we shall see that come to
pass, that so mightily pleases us in the reading
the most ingenious plays and heroic poems,
that long afflicted Virtue at last comes to the
crown, the mouth of all unbelievers must be
stopped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To the work of the ingenious Mr. Swan, the
only translator of these stories that I know of
in this country, I am indebted for my first
introduction to these old tales; and I cannot
conclude these few words without thanking
him for having often lightened my labors by
his close and admirable versions.</p>

Man</span>—Sources of Didactic Fiction—<span class='sc'>Jovinian
the Proud Emperor</span>—Morals of the Tales.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>It was a dull, cold Christmas evening; the snow fell fast
and small, and the cutting northeast wind blew its
white shower into heaps and ridges in every corner of
St. John’s quadrangle, and piled its clear flakes against
every projecting part of the old building. No one was
moving in college, at least out-of-doors; but the rude
laugh from the buttery, and the dull-red gleam through
the closely drawn curtains of one of the upper rooms in
the outer quadrangle, proved that in two portions of the
college Christmas was being kept with plenty and with
gayety.</p>

<p class='c012'>The change from the white cold of the quadrangle to
the ruddy blaze of that upper room was inspiriting. The
fire burnt bright; the small table, drawn immediately
in front of its merry blaze, glittered with after-dinner
good cheer; and three young and happy faces sat by
that little table, and compared their former Christmases
at home, with this one, during which they were
determined to remain up in Oxford and read for the
ensuing examination.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Morrison is always in good luck,” said Henry Herbert,
the youngest of the party. “Whatever it is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>whether drawing lots for a Newham party, or cramming
for an examination, he always succeeds; and now he is
the last man that got away from Oxford before the roads
were blocked up by this snow-drift.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Fortunate fellow!” said Lathom. “We are shut up
now—fifteen feet of snow at Dorchester, and Stokenchurch
bottom quite impassable.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Ay, and Oxford streets equally so,” said Frederick
Thompson, the last of the triumvirate, “and we shut up
here with the pleasant prospect of taking our constitutional,
for some days to come, under the old Archbishop’s
cloisters.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“By the by,” said Herbert, “what were you after in
the old library last week, Lathom?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Looking for a copy of the Gesta Romanorum, with
the idea of reading some of its amusing stories during
our after-dinner sittings.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Any thing but those Romans: it is bad enough to
have read and believed all that Livy wrote, from his
Sucking Wolf to his Capitol Goose, and then to have a
shrewd German prove that kings were not kings, and
consuls not consuls, just when you are beginning to
think that you really do know something about your
Roman history.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will have but little of Roman history, Thompson;
the title of the book but ill agrees with its contents:
fables of all climes contribute their share in the formation
of this singular composition. The majority of the tales
are entirely unconnected with the history of Rome,
though the writer, in order to, in some manner, cover
this deviation from his title, has taken care to preface
almost every story with the name of some emperor, who
in most cases never existed, and sometimes has little to
do with the incidents of the narrative.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To whom, most learned antiquary, are we indebted
for this very stout volume?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“To the imagination, knowledge, and literary labor
of the monks of the middle ages. In the refectory, whilst
the monks ate their meals, one, the youngest generally,
of the society, read from some such collection as this, a
tale at once amusing and instructive. Nor was the use
of these fables confined to the refectory. The success
which has always attended instruction by fables, and
the popularity ever consequent on this form of teaching,
led the monks to use this medium to illustrate
their public discourses, as well as for their own daily
relaxation.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Few things are more certain,” said Herbert, “than
that an argument, however clear,—a deduction, however
logical,—operates but faintly except on trained intellects;
but an apposite story at once arouses the attention,
and makes a more durable impression on illiterate auditors.
Knowledge in the garb of verse is soonest appreciated
by an uneducated mind, and remains there far
longer than in any other form. A ballad will descend
from generation to generation without a fault or an interpolation.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” rejoined Lathom, “and next to poetry comes
poetic prose, at the head of which class stands didactic
fiction. Many a clever man has confessed that he was
more indebted to Shakspeare and Scott for his English
and Scottish history, than to the standard historians of
either land.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And as far as the general belief goes,” said Thompson,
“the popular dramatist or poet will always outweigh
the learned historian. Let Walpole or Turner
write what they will about Richard the Third; to the
majority—ay, to more than four fifths of the people—he
is still Shakspeare’s Richard, the Humpbacked Murderer.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One of the best of the old monks’ stories,” said
Lathom, “was translated in <cite>Blackwood’s Magazine</cite> some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>years since. It well illustrates the popular method by
which the writers of these tales inculcated Christian
duties on their brethren of the convent, or on their
hearers in the Church. If you like, I will read it.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The following was the tale of</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>THE UNGRATEFUL MAN.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Vitalis, a noble Venetian, one day, at a
hunting party, fell into a pit, which had
been dug to catch wild animals. He passed a
whole night and day there, and I will leave you
to imagine his dread and his agony. The pit was
dark. Vitalis ran from the one side of it to the
other, in the hope of finding some branch or
root by which he might climb its sides and get
out of his dungeon; but he heard such confused
and extraordinary noises, growlings, hissings,
and plaintive cries, that he became half-dead
with terror, and crouched in a corner motionless,
awaiting death with the most horrid
dismay. On the morning of the second day he
heard some one passing near the pit, and then
raising his voice he cried out with the most
dolorous accent: “Help, help! draw me out of
this; I am perishing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A peasant crossing the forest heard his cry.
At first he was frightened; but after a moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>or two, taking courage, be approached the pit,
and asked who had called.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A poor huntsman,” answered Vitalis, “who
has passed a long night and day here. Help me
out, for the love of God. Help me out, and I
will recompense you handsomely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will do what I can,” replied the peasant.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Massaccio (such was the name of the
peasant) took a hedge-bill which hung at his
girdle, and cutting a branch of a tree strong
enough to bear a man,—“Listen, huntsman,”
said he, “to what I am going to say to you. I
will let down this branch into the pit. I will
fasten it against the sides, and hold it with my
hands; and by pulling yourself out by it, you
may get free from your prison.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good,” answered Vitalis; “ask me anything
you will, and it shall be granted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ask for nothing,” said the peasant, “but I
am going to get married, and you may give
what you like to my bride.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So saying, Massaccio let down the branch—he
soon felt it heavy, and the moment after a
monkey leapt out of the pit. He had fallen like
Vitalis, and had seized quickly on the branch of
Massaccio. “It was the devil surely which
spoke to me from the pit,” said Massaccio, running
away in affright.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you abandon me, then?” cried Vitalis,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>in a lamentable accent; “my friend, my dear
friend, for the love of the Lord, for the love of
your mistress, draw me out of this; I beg, I implore
you; I will give her wedding gifts, I will
enrich you. I am the Lord Vitalis, a rich Venetian;
do not let me die of hunger in this horrible
pit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Massaccio was touched by these prayers. He
returned to the pit—let down another branch,
and a lion jumped out, making the woods echo
with a roar of delight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh certainly, certainly, it was the devil I
heard,” said Massaccio, and fled away again;
but stopping short, after a few paces, he heard
again the piercing cries of Vitalis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“O God, O God,” cried he, “to die of hunger
in a pit! Will no one then come to my help?
Whoever you may be, I implore you return; let
me not die, when you can save me. I will give
you a house and field, and cows and gold, all
that you can ask for; save me, save me only.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Massaccio, thus implored, could not help returning.
He let down the branch, and a serpent,
hissing joyously, sprang out of the pit.
Massaccio fell on his knees, half-dead with fear,
and repeated all the prayers he could think of
to drive away the demon. He was only brought
to himself by hearing the cries of despair which
Vitalis uttered.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Will no one help me?” said he. “Ah,
then, must I die? O God, O God!” and he
wept and sobbed in a heart-breaking manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is certainly the voice of a man for all
that,” said Massaccio.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, if you are still there,” said Vitalis, “in
the name of all that is dear to you, save me,
that I may die at least at home, and not in this
horrible pit. I can say no more; my voice is
exhausted. Shall I give you my palace at
Venice, my possessions, my honors? I give
them all; and may I die if I forfeit my word.
Life, life only; save only my life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Massaccio could not resist such prayers, and
mingled with such promises. He let down the
branch again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, here you are at last,” said he, seeing
Vitalis come up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said he, and uttering a cry of joy he
fainted in the arms of Massaccio.</p>

<p class='c007'>Massaccio sustained, assisted him, and brought
him to himself; then, giving him his arm,—“Let
us,” said he, “quit this forest”; but Vitalis
could hardly walk,—he was exhausted with
hunger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eat this piece of bread,” said Massaccio,
and he gave him some which he took out of his
wallet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My benefactor, my savior, my good angel,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>said Vitalis, “how can I ever sufficiently recompense
you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have promised me a marriage portion
for my bride, and your palace at Venice for myself,”
said Massaccio. But Vitalis now began to
regain his strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, certainly, I will give a portion to your
wife, my dear Massaccio, and I will make you
the richest peasant of your village. Where do
you live?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“At Capalatta in the forest; but I would
willingly quit my village to establish myself at
Venice in the palace you have promised me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here we are out of the forest,” said Vitalis;
“I know my road now; thank you, Massaccio.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But when shall I come for my palace and
the portion for my intended?” returned the
peasant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When you will,” said the other, and they
separated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vitalis went to Venice, and Massaccio to
Capalatta, where he related his adventure to his
mistress, telling her what a rich portion she
was to have, and what a fine palace she was to
live in.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day early he set out for Venice, and
asked for the palace of the Signor Vitalis,—went
straight to it, and told the domestics that
he should come shortly with his mistress, in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>fine carriage, to take possession of the palace
which the Signor Vitalis had promised to give
him. Massaccio appeared to those who heard
him mad, and Vitalis was told that there was a
peasant in his hall, who asked for a marriage
portion, and said the palace belonged to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let him be turned out immediately,” said
Vitalis, “I know him not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The valets accordingly drove him away with
insults, and Massaccio returned to his cottage in
despair, without daring to see his mistress. At
one corner of his fireplace was seated the monkey,
at the other corner the lion, and the
serpent had twisted itself in spiral circles upon
the hearth. Massaccio was seized with fear.
“The man has driven me from his door,”
thought he; “the lion will certainly devour
me, the serpent sting me, and the monkey laugh
at me; and this will be my reward for saving
them from the pit.” But the monkey turned
to him with a most amicable grimace; the lion,
vibrating gently his tail, came and licked his
hand, like a dog caressing his master; and the
serpent, unrolling its ringy body, moved about
the room with a contented and grateful air,
which gave courage to Massaccio.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor animals!” said he, “they are better
than the Signor Vitalis; he drove me like a
beggar from the door. Ah! with what pleasure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>I would pitch him again into the pit! And my
bride! whom I thought to marry so magnificently!
I have not a stick of wood in my wood-house,
not a morsel of meat for a meal, and no
money to buy any. The ungrateful wretch,
with his portion and his palace!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus did Massaccio complain. Meanwhile
the monkey began to make significant faces, the
lion to agitate his tail with great uneasiness, and
the serpent to roll and unroll its circles with
great rapidity. Then the monkey, approaching
his benefactor, made him a sign to follow, and
led him into the wood-house, where was regularly
piled up a quantity of wood sufficient for
the whole year. It was the monkey who had
collected this wood in the forest, and brought
it to the cottage of Massaccio. Massaccio embraced
the grateful ape. The lion then uttering
a delicate roar, led him to a corner of the
cottage, where he saw an enormous provision of
game, two sheep, three kids, hares and rabbits
in abundance, and a fine wild boar, all covered
with the branches of trees to keep them fresh.
It was the lion who had hunted for his benefactor.
Massaccio patted kindly his mane.
“And you, then,” said he to the serpent, “have
you brought me nothing? Art thou a Vitalis,
or a good and honest animal like the monkey
and the lion?” The serpent glided rapidly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>under a heap of dried leaves, and reappeared
immediately, rearing itself superbly on its tail,
when Massaccio saw with surprise a beautiful
diamond in its mouth. “A diamond!” cried
Massaccio, and stretched forth his hand to
stroke caressingly the serpent and take its
offering.</p>

<p class='c007'>Massaccio then set out immediately for Venice
to turn his diamond into money. He addressed
himself to a jeweller. The jeweller examined
the diamond; it was of the finest water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How much do you ask for it?” said he.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two hundred crowns,” said Massaccio,
thinking his demand to be great; it was hardly
the tenth part of the value of the stone. The
jeweller looked at Massaccio, and said: “To sell
it at that price you must be a robber, and I
arrest you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it is not worth so much, give me less,”
said Massaccio; “I am not a robber, I am an
honest man; it was the serpent who gave me
the diamond.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the police now arrived and conducted
him before the magistrate. There he recounted
his adventure, which appeared to be a mere
fairy vision. Yet as the Signor Vitalis was implicated
in the story, the magistrate referred the
affair to the state inquisition, and Massaccio
appeared before it.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Relate to us your history,” said one of the
inquisitors, “and lie not, or we will have you
thrown into the canal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Massaccio related his adventure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So,” said the inquisitor, “you saved the
Signor Vitalis?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, noble signors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he promised you a marriage portion for
your bride, and his palace at Venice for yourself?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, noble signors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he drove you like a beggar from his
door?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, noble signors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let the Signor Vitalis appear,” said the
same inquisitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vitalis appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know this man, Signor Vitalis?”
said the inquisitor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I know him not,” replied Vitalis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The inquisitors consulted together. “This
man,” said they, speaking of Massaccio, “is evidently
a knave and a cheat; he must be thrown
into prison. Signor Vitalis, you are acquitted.”
Then, making a sign to an officer of police,
“Take that man,” said he, “to prison.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Massaccio fell on his knees in the middle of
the hall. “Noble signors, noble signors,” said
he, “it is possible that the diamond may have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>been stolen; the serpent who gave it me may
have wished to deceive me. It is possible that
the ape, the lion, and the serpent may all be an
illusion of the demon, but it is true that I saved
the Signor Vitalis. Signor Vitalis” (turning to
him), “I ask you not for the marriage portion
for my bride, nor for your palace of marble, but
say a word for me; suffer me not to be thrown
into prison; do not abandon me; I did not
abandon you when you were in the pit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Noble signors,” said Vitalis, bowing to the
tribunal, “I can only repeat what I have already
said: I know not this man. Has he a single
witness to produce?”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment the whole court was thrown
into fear and astonishment, for the lion, the
monkey, and the serpent, entered the hall together.
The monkey was mounted on the back
of the lion, and the serpent was twined round
the arm of the monkey. On entering, the lion
roared, the monkey spluttered, and the serpent
hissed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! these are the animals of the pit,” cried
Vitalis, in alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Signor Vitalis,” resumed the chief of the
inquisitors, when the dismay which this apparition
had caused had somewhat diminished,
“you have asked where were the witnesses of
Massaccio. You see that God has sent them at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the right time before the bar of our tribunal.
Since, then, God has testified against you, we
should be culpable before Him if we did not
punish your ingratitude. Your palace and your
possessions are confiscated, and you shall pass
the rest of your life in a narrow prison. And
you,” continued he, addressing himself to Massaccio,
who was all this time caressing the lion,
the monkey, and the serpent, “since a Venetian
has promised you a palace of marble, and a
portion for your bride, the republic of Venice
will accomplish the promise; the palace and
possessions of Vitalis are thine. You,” said
he to the secretary of the tribunal, “draw up an
account of all this history, that the people of
Venice may know, through all generations, that
the justice of the tribunal of the state inquisition
is not less equitable than it is rigorous.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Massaccio and his wife lived happily for many
years afterwards in the palace of Vitalis with
the monkey, the lion, and the serpent; and
Massaccio had them represented in a picture, on
the wall of his palace, as they entered the hall
of the tribunal, the lion carrying the monkey,
and the monkey carrying the serpent.</p>

<p class='c015'>“To what source can this tale be traced?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To the Arabian fable book called Callah-u-Dumnah,”
replied Lathom. “Mathew Paris recites it as a fable
commonly used by our crusading Richard to reprove his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>ungodly nobles, and old Gower has versified it in his
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Confessio Amantis</span>. The translator in <cite>Blackwood</cite> seems
not to have been aware of its existence in the Gesta Romanorum,
content to translate it from the later version
of Massenius, a German Jesuit, who lived at Cologne in
1657.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Few subjects,” said Herbert, “seem more involved
than the history of didactic fiction. The more mysterious
an investigation bids fair to be, the less we have to
depend on fact, and the more we are at the mercy of conjecture,
so much the more does the mind love to grasp at
the mystery, and delight in the dim perspective and intricacies
of the way. Each successive adventurer finds it
more easy to pull down the various bridges, and break in
the various cuttings by which his predecessor has endeavored
to make the way straight, than to throw his
own bridge over the river or the morass of time that intervenes
between the traveller and the goal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Four distinct sources,” said Lathom, “have been
contended for: the Scandinavian bards, the Arabians of
the Spanish peninsula, the Armoricans or Bretons, and
the classical authors of Greece and Rome. Mallet and
Bishop Percy came forward as the advocates of Scandinavia;
Dr. Wharton writes himself the champion of the
Spanish Arabians; Wilson is rather inclined to the Breton
theory; and Dr. Southey and Mr. Dunlop come forward
as the advocates of the classical and mythological
authors; whilst Sir Henry Ellis would reconcile all differences
by a quiet jumble of Breton scenes colored by
Scandinavia and worked by Arabian machinery. Let us,
however, adjourn this subject until to-morrow, as I wish
to read you another of these tales, in order to give you
some idea of the moral applications and explanations
appended to them by the monkish writers. We will take
Jovinian the Proud Emperor, and in this case you must
be content with my own translation.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>
  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>JOVINIAN THE PROUD EMPEROR.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>In the days of old, when the empire of the
world was in the hands of the lord of Rome,
Jovinian was emperor. Oft as he lay on his
couch, and mused upon his power and his
wealth, his heart was elated beyond measure,
and he said within himself: “Verily, there is
no other god than me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It happened one morning after he had thus
said unto himself, that the emperor arose, and
summoning his huntsmen and his friends, hastened
to chase the wild deer of the forest. The
chase was long and swift, and the sun was high
in the heavens, when Jovinian reined up his
horse on the bank of a clear bright stream that
ran through the fertile country on which his
palace stood. Allured by the refreshing appearance
of the stream, he bade his attendants abide
still, whilst he sought a secluded pool beneath
some willows, where he might bathe unseen.</p>

<p class='c007'>The emperor hastened to the pool, cast off his
garments, and revelled in the refreshing coolness
of the waters. But whilst he thus bathed,
a person like to him in form, in feature, and in
voice, approached the river’s bank, arrayed
himself unperceived in the imperial garments,
and then sprang on Jovinian’s horse, and rode
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>to meet the huntsmen, who, deceived by the
likeness and the dress, obeyed his commands,
and followed their new emperor to the palace
gates.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jovinian at length quitted the water, and
sought in every direction for his apparel and his
horse, but could not find them. He called
aloud upon his attendants, but they heard him
not, being already in attendance on the false
emperor. And Jovinian regarded his nakedness
and said: “Miserable man that I am! to what
a state am I reduced! Whither shall I go?
Who will receive me in this plight? I bethink
me there is a knight hereabout whom I have
advanced to great honor; I will seek him, and
with his assistance regain my palace, and punish
the person who has done me this wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Naked and ashamed, Jovinian sought the gate
of the knight’s castle, and knocked loudly at
the wicket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who art thou, and what dost thou seek?”
asked the porter, without unclosing the gate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Open, open, sirrah!” replied the emperor,
with redoubled knocks on the wicket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the name of wonder, friend, who art
thou?” said the old porter as he opened the
gate, and saw the strange figure of the emperor
before the threshold.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who am I, askest thou, sirrah? I am thy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>emperor. Go, tell thy master, Jovinian is at his
gate, and bid him bring forth a horse and some
garments, to supply those that I have been deprived
of.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Rascal,” rejoined the porter—“thou the
emperor! Why, the emperor but just now rode
up to the castle, with all his attendants, and
honored my master by sitting with him at meat
in the great hall. Thou the emperor! a very
pretty emperor indeed; faugh, I’ll tell my master
what you say, and he will soon find out
whether you are mad, drunk, or a thief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The porter, greatly enraged, went and told his
lord how that a naked fellow stood at the gate,
calling himself the emperor, and demanding
clothes and a good steed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bring the fellow in,” said the knight.</p>

<p class='c007'>So they brought in Jovinian, and he stood before
the lord of the castle, and again declared
himself to be the emperor Jovinian. Loud
laughed the knight to the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, thou my lord the emperor! art mad,
good fellow? Come, give him my old cloak; it
will keep him from the flies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, sir knight,” replied Jovinian, “I am
thy emperor, who advanced thee to great honor
and wealth, and will shortly punish thee for thy
present conduct.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Scoundrel!” said the knight, now enraged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>beyond all bounds, “traitor! thou the emperor!
ay, of beggars and fools. Why, did not
my lord but lately sit with me in my hall, and
taste of my poor cheer? and did not he bid me
ride with him to his palace gate, whence I am
but now returned? Fool, I pitied thee before;
now I see thy villany. Go, turn the fellow
out, and flog him from the castle-ditch to the
river-side.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the people did as the knight commanded
them. So when they ceased from flogging the
emperor, he sat him down on the grass, and
covered him with the tattered robe, and communed
on his own wretchedness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my God!” said Jovinian,—for he now
thought of other gods but himself,—“is it possible
that I have come to such a state of misery,
and that, through the ingratitude of one whom
I have raised so high!” And as he thus spake,
he thought not of his own ingratitude to his God,
through whom alone all princes reign and live.
And now he brooded over vengeance—“Ay,”
said he, as he felt the sore weals on his back
from the scourging; “ay, I will be avenged.
When he next sees me, he shall know that he
who gives can also take away. Come, I will
seek the good duke, my ablest counsellor; he
will know his sovereign, and gladly aid him in
his calamity.” And with these thoughts he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>wrapped his cloak round him, and sought the
house of the good duke.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jovinian knocked at the gate of the duke’s
palace, and the porter opened the wicket, and
seeing a half-naked man, asked him why he
knocked, and who he was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friend,” replied the emperor, “I am Jovinian.
I have been robbed of my clothes whilst
bathing, and am now with no apparel, save this
ragged cloak, and no horse; so tell the duke the
emperor is here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The porter, more and more astonished at the
emperor’s words, sought his master, and delivered
Jovinian’s message to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bring in the poor man,” said the duke;
“peradventure he is mad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So they brought Jovinian unto the duke’s
great hall, and the duke looked on him, but
knew him not. And when Jovinian reiterated
his story, and spoke angrily unto the duke, he
pitied him. “Poor mad fellow,” said the good
duke, “I have but just now returned from the
palace, where I left the very emperor thou assumest
to be. Take him to the guard-house.
Perhaps a few days’ close confinement on bread
and water may cool his heated brain. Go, poor
fellow; I pity thee!”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the servants did as their lord commanded,
and they fed Jovinian on bread and water, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>after a time turned him out of the castle; for he
still said he was the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sorely and bitterly did the emperor weep and
bewail his miserable fate when the servants
drove him from the castle gate. “Alas, alas!”
he exclaimed in his misery, “what shall I do,
and whither shall I resort? Even the good
duke knew me not, but regarded me as a poor
madman. Come, I will seek my own palace,
and discover myself to my wife. Surely she will
know me at least.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who art thou, poor man?” asked the king’s
porter of him when he stood before the palace
gate and would have entered in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thou oughtest to know me,” replied Jovinian,
“seeing thou hast served me these fifteen
years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Served you, you dirty fellow,” rejoined the
porter. “I serve the emperor. Serve you, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am the emperor. Dost thou not know
me? Come, my good fellow, seek the empress,
and bid her, by the sign of the three moles on
the emperor’s breast, send me hither the imperial
robes, which some fellow stole whilst I was
bathing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! ha! fellow; well, you are royally mad.
Why, the emperor is at dinner with his wife.
Well, well, I’ll do thy bidding, if it be but to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>have the whipping of thee afterwards for an impudent
madman. Three moles on the emperor’s
breast! how royally thou shalt be beaten, my
friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the porter told the empress what the
poor madman at the gate had said, she held
down her head, and said, with a sorrowful
voice, unto her lord: “My good lord and
king, here is a fellow at the palace gate that
hath sent unto me, and bids me, by those secret
signs known only to thee and me, to send him
the imperial robes, and welcome him as my
husband and my sovereign.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the fictitious emperor heard this, he
bade the attendants bring in Jovinian. And lo,
as he entered the hall, the great wolf-hound,
that had slept at his feet for years, sprang from
his lair, and would have pulled him down, had
not the attendants prevented him; whilst the
falcon, that had sat on his wrist in many a fair
day’s hawking, broke her jesses, and flew out
of the hall: so changed was Jovinian the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nobles and friends,” said the new emperor,
“hear ye what I will ask of this man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the nobles bowed assent, whilst the emperor
asked Jovinian his name, and his business
with the empress.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Askest thou me who I am, and wherefore I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>am come?” rejoined Jovinian. “Am not I thy
emperor, and the lord of this house and this
realm?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“These our nobles shall decide,” replied the
new king. “Tell me now, which of us twain is
your emperor?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the nobles answered with one accord:
“Thou dost trifle with us, sire. Can we doubt
that thou art our emperor, whom we have known
from his childhood? As for this base fellow,
we know not who he is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And with one accord the people cried out
against Jovinian that he should be punished.</p>

<p class='c007'>On this the usurper turned to the empress of
Jovinian—“Tell me,” said he, “on thy true
faith, knowest thou this man who calls himself
emperor of this realm?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the empress answered: “Good my lord,
have not thirty years passed since I first knew
thee, and became the mother of our children?
Why askest thou me of this fellow? and yet it
doth surprise me how he should know what none
save you and I can know?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the usurper turned to Jovinian, and
with a harsh countenance rebuked his presumption,
and ordered the executioners to drag
him by the feet by horses until he died. This
said he before all his court; but he sent his
servant to the tailor, and commanded him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>scourge Jovinian; and for this once to set him
free.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deposed emperor desired death. “Why,”
said he to himself, “should I now live? my
friends, my dependents, yea, even the partner
of my bed shuns me, and I am desolate among
those whom my bounties have raised. Come, I
will seek the good priest, to whom I so often
have laid open my most secret faults: of a
surety, he will remember me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the good priest lived in a small cell,
nigh to a chapel about a stone’s-cast from the
palace gate; and when Jovinian knocked, the
priest, being engaged in reading, answered from
within: “Who is there? why troublest thou
me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am the emperor Jovinian; open the window,
I would speak to thee,” replied the fugitive.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately the narrow window of the cell
was opened, and the priest, looking out, saw no
one save the poor half-clothed Jovinian. “Depart
from me, thou accursed thing!” cried the priest;
“thou art not our good lord the emperor, but
the foul fiend himself, the great tempter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alas, alas!” cried Jovinian, “to what fate
am I reserved, that even my own good priest
despises me! Ah me, I bethink me—in the
arrogance of my heart, I called myself a god:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>the weight of my sin is grievous unto me.
Father, good father, hear the sins of a miserable
penitent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gladly did the priest listen to Jovinian; and
when he had told him all his sins, the good
priest comforted the penitent, and assured him
of God’s mercy, if his repentance was sincere.
And so it happened that on this a cloud
seemed to fall from before the eyes of the
priest; and when he again looked on Jovinian
he knew him to be the emperor, and he
pitied him, clothing him with such poor garments
as he had, and went with him to the
palace gate.</p>

<p class='c007'>The porter stood in the gateway, and as
Jovinian and the priest drew near he made a
lowly obeisance, and opened the gate for the
emperor. “Dost thou know me?” asked the
emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, my lord,” replied the servant;
“but I wish that you had not left the palace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Jovinian passed on to the hall of his
palace; and as he went, all the nobles rose and
bowed to the emperor; for the usurper was in
another apartment, and the nobles knew again
the face of Jovinian.</p>

<p class='c007'>But a certain knight passed into the presence
of the false emperor. “My lord,” said he,
“there is one in the great hall to whom all men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>bow, for he so much resembleth you that we
know not which is the emperor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then said the usurper to the empress: “Go
and see if you know this man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my good lord,” said the empress, when
she returned from the hall, “whom can I believe?
are there, then, two Jovinians?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will myself go and determine,” rejoined
the usurper, as he took the empress by her
hand, and, leading her into the great hall,
placed her on the throne beside himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Kinsfolk and nobles,” said the usurper, “by
the oaths ye have sworn, determine between me
and this man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the empress answered: “Let me, as in
duty bound, speak first. Heaven be my witness,
I know not which is my lord and husband.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And all the nobles said the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thereupon the feigned Jovinian rose and
spake: “Nobles and friends, hearken! that
man is your emperor and your master; hear ye
him; know that he did exalt himself above that
which was right, and make himself equal unto
God. Verily he hath been rewarded; he hath
suffered much indignity and wrong, and, of
God’s will, ye knew him not; he hath repented
him of his grievous sin, and the scourge is now
removed; he has made such satisfaction as man
can make. Hear ye him, know him, obey him.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>As the feigned emperor thus addressed the
astonished nobles, his features seemed illumined
with a fair and spiritual light, his imperial robes
fell from off him, and he stood confessed before
the assembly an angel of God, clothed in white
raiment. And, as he ended his speech, he
bowed his head, and vanished from their sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jovinian returned to his throne, and for three
years reigned with so much mercy and justice,
that his subjects had no cause to regret the
change of their emperor. And it came to pass,
after the space of three years, the same angel
appeared to him in a dream, and warned him of
his death. So Jovinian dictated his troublous
life to his secretaries, that it might remain as a
warning unto all men against worldly pride, and
an incitement to the performance of our religious
duties. And when he had so done, he
meekly resigned himself, and fell asleep in
death.</p>

<p class='c015'>“So much for the story, as a story; now for the moral,
with all that eccentric spirit of refinement and abstraction
with which the age was characterized,” said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The moral in this case is less eccentric than in many
to which I hope we shall come before Christmas is
over.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Jovinian was but the picture of the proud, worldly-minded
man, entirely given up to vanity and folly. The
first knight whose castle he visited was True Wisdom,
ever disdainful of the pomps and vanities of the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>The next knight was Conscience. The dog that turned
against his old master, was the lusts of the flesh, our own
evil desires, which will ever in the end turn against
those who have pampered them. The falcon is God’s
grace; the empress, man’s soul; and the clothes in
which the good priest clothed the half-frozen emperor,
are those kingly virtues which he had thrown off, when
he gave loose rein to the vanities of the world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It must be admitted,” remarked Herbert, “that
from very early times a secondary meaning was commonly
attached to every important work; it progressed
from the sacred writings through the poetic fictions of
the classics, to compositions professedly allegorical. The
want of discrimination, which in our eyes assumes
much of the appearance of profane levity, with which
the fictions of the classics were interpreted to signify the
great truths and mysteries of religion, was, perhaps,
hardly reprehensible in the simple state of knowledge
which prevailed at the time when these attempts at
secondary interpretation were made.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And hence it was,” said Lathom, “that in the early
ages it might seem to partake of little levity to prefigure
our Saviour’s birth in that of Bacchus; his sufferings
and death in that of Actæon, or his resurrection in the
legend of Hercules, as related by Lycophron; as late as
the thirteenth century the Franciscan Walleys wrote a
moral and theological exposition of the Metamorphoses
of Ovid.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But surely the writers of that age did not stop there,”
said Thompson; “was it not the case, that to these expositions
succeeded compositions professedly allegorical,
and which the spirit of refinement of that age resolved
into further allegories, for which they were never intended?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Undoubtedly so!” replied Lathom; “it was not
enough that the writer of the ‘Romaunt of the Rose’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>had allegorized the difficulties of an ardent lover in the
accomplishment of his object, under the mystery of the
rose which was to be gathered in a fair but almost inaccessible
garden. Every profession saw in this allegory
the great mystery of their craft. To the theologian it
was the rose of Jericho, the New Jerusalem, the Blessed
Virgin, or any other mystery to which obstinate heretics
were unable to attain; to the chemist it was the philosopher’s
stone; to the lawyer it was the most consummate
point of equity; to the physician the infallible panacea,
the water of life; and does not this spirit of allegory
extend to the present day, only in a somewhat different
form?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not unlike the present system of commentating,”
remarked Henry Herbert. “As soon as a poet has attained
to any great reputation, and death has sealed up
his writings, then comes the host of annotators and
critics, each one more intent than his predecessor to
develop the mind of the writer, to discover with what
hidden intentions, with what feelings, this or that passage
was written, and to build on some stray expression
a mighty theory, for some more clever writer to overthrow,
and raise a new fabric on its ruins. And in these
attempts it is not the old author whose glory is sought to
be heightened, but the new man who would ascend the
ladder of reputation on the labors of the ‘man of old.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Far different,” rejoined Lathom, “was the spirit
which prompted the fashion of resolving every thing
into allegories in the middle ages; nor, indeed, is it to be
solely charged to an unmeaning and wanton spirit of refinement.
‘The same apology,’ says Wharton, ‘may be
offered for cabalistic interpreters, both of the classics and
of the old romances. The former, not willing that those
books should be quite exploded which contained the
ancient mythology, labored to reconcile the apparent
absurdities of the pagan system with the Christian mysteries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>by demonstrating a figurative resemblance. The
latter, as true learning began to dawn, with a view of
supporting for a time the expiring credit of giants and
magicians, were compelled to palliate those monstrous
incredibilities, by a bold attempt to unravel the mystic
web which had been woven by fairy hands, and by showing
that truth was hid under the gorgeous veil of gothic
invention.’ And now, Thompson, we must adjourn, you
to your real Greeks and Romans, Herbert and I to Aristotle’s
Summum Bonum.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Discussion on the Source of Fiction Renewed—<span class='sc'>The King
and the Glutton</span>—<span class='sc'>Guido, the Perfect Servant</span>—The
Middle-Age Allegories—Pliny and Mandeville’s
Wonders Allegorized.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“Surely,” said Henry Herbert, when the friends
were again assembled, “surely the poems of the
northern Scalds, the legends of the Arabians of Spain,
the songs of the Armoricans, and the classics of the ancient
world, have been the sources of the most prevalent
fictions.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The sources from which the monks themselves
compiled these stories, but by no means the original
sources,” replied Lathom. “The <i>immediate</i> source must
be sought in even earlier times and more eastern climes.
In some instances perverted notions of Scripture characters
furnished the supernatural agency of the legend; in
the majority the machinery came direct from the East,
already dilated and improved. In many parts of the old
Scriptures we learn how familiar the nations of the East
were with spells; and the elevation of Solomon Daoud
to the throne of the Genii and to the lordship of the
Talisman, proves the <i>traditional</i> intercourse between
God’s own people and the nations of the far East.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The theory is probable,” said Thompson. “We can
easily conceive how the contest of David and Goliath
may have formed the foundation of many a fierce encounter
between knight and giant, and the feats of Samson
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>been dilated into the miracles of the heroes of
chivalry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is one very pertinent instance of such a conversion
in this very book. In the Book of Tobit, which
is indeed referred to in the application of the tale of
‘The Emperor Vespasian and the Two Rings,’ we find
an angel in the place of a saint, enchantments, antidotes,
distressed damsels, demons, and nearly all the recognized
machinery of fiction. The vagaries of the Talmud,
clearly derived from Eastern sources, were no small
treasure on which to draw for wonders and miracles.
And when we find all the machinery of the East in the
poems of the Scalds, we cannot but perceive how much
more reasonable it is to suppose the cold conceptions of
the Northern bards to have been fed from the East, than
the warm imaginations of the East to have drawn their
inspiration from the North.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Very plausible, Lathom,” replied Herbert; “but still
this objection must not be neglected—the ignorance and
misrepresentation of the religions of the East, shown
through every page of the popular legends of the chivalric
age.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“An objection of apparent weight, I will admit; and
yet may it not have been the aim of the Christian writers
to represent the infidels in the worst possible light, to
pervert their creed, to exaggerate their vices? The
charge of idolatry, and the adoration of the golden image
of Mahomet, may have been mere pious frauds.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Admitting even this apology,” rejoined Herbert,
“the difference of religion in the East and North seems
another objection. The Romans adopted the legends of
Greece, and naturalized them. With the mythology
came the religious rites appendant to it. How did it
happen that the Scalds adopted the one without falling
into the other error?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Are the cases similar?” replied Lathom; “were the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>nations alike? Was there no difference of predisposition
in the Romans and the Scalds as to the adoption of the
mythologies of the East and Greece? Had not long intercourse
in the one case prepared the Romans to receive?
did it not agree with their preconceived notions? Such
was not the case with the Northern nations. Children,
and rude children of nature, they were in no way prepared
for a similar effect; but, seizing on the prominent
features of the legends presented to them, they engrafted
them on their own wild and terrible stories, adding to
the original matter in some cases, and rejecting portions
of it in others.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, I will not carry this discussion further,” said
Herbert, “for fear of losing a story to-night; but I by no
means give up my sources of didactic fictions.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, then, a truce for this evening. I will read the
tale of The King and the Glutton, by which the old monk
wished to illustrate the moral, that men are blinded by
their own avarice.”</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>THE KING AND THE GLUTTON.</h3>

<p class='c014'>There once lived a king of Rome, who, out
of charity to the blind, decreed that every
subject of his that was so afflicted, should be
entitled to receive a hundred shillings from the
royal treasury. Now there was in Rome a club
of men who lived for the world alone, and spent
all they had in rioting and eating. Seven days
had they continued revelling in one tavern,
when the host demanded to be paid his bill.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Every one searched his pockets, but still there
was not enough to pay the reckoning.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There still wants one hundred shillings,”
said the innkeeper; “and until that is paid, ye
go not hence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These young men knew not what to do, as
they were penniless. “What shall we do?”
said they one to another. “How can we pay so
large a sum?” At length one bethought him
of the king’s edict.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Listen,” said he, “listen to me; does not
the king give one hundred shillings to every
blind man that applies for it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even so,” said the rest; “but what then?
we are not blind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What then?” rejoined the young man.
“Come, let us cast lots who shall be made
blind, that when he is deprived of sight we may
take him to the king’s palace, and obtain the
hundred shillings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the young men cast lots, and the lot fell
upon the man who had proposed this plan.
And the rest took him, and putting out his eyes,
led him to the king’s palace. When they
knocked at the gate, the porter opened the
wicket, and demanded their business.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Business,” said they; “see ye not our companion
is blind? he seeks to receive the king’s
benevolent gift.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“The blindness is rather sudden,” muttered
the porter, who knew the young man by sight.
“Well, well, I will fetch the almoner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the almoner, who distributed the king’s
charity, came to the gate, and looking on the
young man, asked him what he wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A hundred shillings, which my lord the
king gives to those that are blind,” replied the
youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thy blindness is very sudden,” rejoined the
almoner; “when did it happen, and where?
for I saw thee yesterday with both eyes perfect
in the tavern by the city wall.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Last night, noble sir,” replied the blind
man, “last night at that tavern I became
blind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go fetch the host,” said the almoner sternly,
“we will look into this matter more fully.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So when the innkeeper came, he inquired of
him how the matter was; and when he had
heard all their deeds, he turned to the young
man, and said—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of a surety thou knowest but half the law,
and dost interpret it wrong; to such as are blind
by God’s act, does our gracious king give his
charity; such the law protects and relieves.
But thou—why art thou blind? Thinkest thou
that thou dost deserve to be rewarded for voluntarily
surrendering thine eyes, in order to discharge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the debt thou and thy companions had
contracted by gluttony and rioting? Begone,
foolish man: thy avarice hath made thee blind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So they drove away the young men from the
king’s gate, lamenting their folly and wickedness.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There can be little doubt,” said Herbert, “what moral
the author of this tale intended to teach. The king’s
gift clearly illustrates God’s reward for forgiveness, to
those that by natural infirmity and temptation fall into
sin; as the withholding it from the glutton, is meant to
teach us how difficult it will be to obtain the forgiveness
of voluntary sin, done out of pure wickedness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have found out the monk’s moral rightly in this
tale, Henry; but I think you will not be so successful in
that which I now propose reading to you—the story of</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“GUIDO, THE PERFECT SERVANT.”</h3>

<p class='c014'>There was once a great emperor of Rome
named Valerius, who would that every
man, according to his wishes, should serve him;
so he commanded that whosoever should strike
<i>three</i> times on the gate of his palace should be
admitted to do him service. In the emperor’s
kingdom was also a poor man named Guido,
who, when he heard of his lord’s commands,
thus spake with himself: “Now, I am a poor
man, and lowly born; is it not better to live and
serve than to starve and be free?” So he went to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the king’s gate, and knocked three knocks; and
lo, it was opened to him, according as it had been
said; and he was brought before the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What seek you, friend?” asked Valerius,
as Guido bowed before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To serve my king,” was Guido’s reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What service can you perform for me?” rejoined
the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Six services can I perform, O king: as your
body-guard, I can prepare your bed and your
food, and attend your chamber. I can sleep
when others watch, and watch while others
sleep. As your cup-bearer, I can drink good
wine, and tell whether it be so or not. I can
summon the guests to my master’s banquet, to
his great honor and benefit. I can kindle a fire
which shall warm all that seek it, and yet not
smoke. And I can show the way to the Holy
Land, to the health of such as shall go thither.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By my truth,” rejoined the emperor, “these
are great things that thou dost promise. See
that thou do them. Each for one year. Serve
me first as my body-guard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Guido was content to obey the emperor; and
he prepared to perform his duties as his body-guard.
Every night he made ready the emperor’s
bed, and prepared his apparel. Every
night he lay before the emperor’s chamber-door,
armed at all points; whilst by his side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>watched a faithful dog to warn him of the approach
of danger. In every thing did he minister
so faithfully to his lord, that the emperor
was well pleased with him, and after his first
year, made him seneschal of his castle and steward
of his household. Then did Guido commence
his labors in his second office. During
the entire summer he gathered large stores of
every thing needful into the castle, and collected
much provision at little cost, by carefully
watching his opportunities. Anon came on the
winter, and when those who had slept during
the times of plenty began to labor and lay up in
their store-houses, Guido remained at ease, and
completed his second year’s service with credit
to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now the third year of Guido’s service
came on; and the emperor called for his chief
butler, and said: “Mix in a cup good wine,
must, and vinegar, and give it to Guido
to drink; that we may know how he doth
taste good drink, and what he knoweth of its
qualities.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the butler did as he was ordered, and gave
the cup to Guido, who, when he had tasted of
it, said: “Of a truth it was good, it is good, and
it will be good.” And when the emperor asked
him how these things could be, he said: “The
vinegar was good, the old wine is good, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>must will be good when it is older.” So the
emperor saw that he had answered rightly and
discreetly of the mixture, which he knew not
of before. “Go, therefore,” said Valerius,
“through my country, and invite my friends to
a banquet at the festival of Christmas now at
hand”; and Guido bowed assent, and departed
on his way.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Guido did not execute his lord’s commands—going
not unto his friends, but unto his
enemies. So that when the emperor descended
into his banquet-hall his heart was troubled;
for his enemies sat round his table, and there
was not a friend among them. So he called
Guido, and spake angrily to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How, sir! didst thou not tell me that thou
knewest whom to invite to my banquet?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Guido said: “Of a surety, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did not I bid thee invite my friends? and
how, then, hast thou summoned all mine enemies?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Guido said: “May thy servant speak?”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the emperor said: “Speak on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the servant said: “My lord, there is no
season or time that thy friends may not visit
thee, and be received with pleasure and honor;
but it is not so with thine enemies. Then I said
to myself: ‘Conciliation and kindness would
go far to convert enemies into friends.’”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Now it turned out as Guido hoped; for ere
the feast was ended, the king and his enemies
were reconciled to each other, and became
friends even unto the end of their days. So the
emperor called Guido, and said: “With God’s
blessing, thy design has prospered. Come,
now, make for my reconciled enemies and me
a fire that shall burn without smoke.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Guido answered: “It shall be done as
thou hast required, O king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So he sent and gathered much green wood,
and dried it in the sun until it was quite dry,
and therewith made a fire that did cast out
much heat, and yet did not smoke. So that the
emperor and his friends rejoiced greatly therein.
And so it was when the emperor saw how well
Guido had performed his five ministries, he bade
him execute his sixth service—that he might
attain to great honor in his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” said Guido, “he that would know
the way to the Holy Land must follow me to the
sea-shore.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So a proclamation went forth from the king
to that effect; and great multitudes of men and
women flocked to the sea-shore after Guido.
When the people were come, Guido said: “My
friends, do ye see in the ocean the things that
I see?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the people answered: “We know not.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“See ye in the midst of the waves a huge
rock?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the people answered: “It is even so.
Why ask you this of us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Know ye all,” replied Guido, “that on that
rock liveth a bird, that sitteth continually on
her nest, in which are seven eggs. While she
so sitteth, behold the sea is calm, and men may
pass to and fro over the wide waters in safety.
But when she doth quit her nest, the winds blow,
and the waves rise, and many perish on the
waters.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then said the people: “How shall we know
when this bird quitteth her nest?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Guido answered: “She sitteth always,
unless a sudden emergency happen; and then
when she is away there cometh another bird,
great and strong, that defileth her nest and
breaketh her seven eggs, which, when the first
bird seeth, she flieth away, and the winds and
storms arise; then must the shipman remain in
port.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then said the people: “Master, how may we
prevent these things, and defend the bird and
her nest from her enemy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Guido said: “The enemy hateth the
blood of the lamb, and cannot come where that
is. Sprinkle, therefore, the inside and outside
of the nest with this blood; and so long as one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>drop remaineth the friendly bird will sit in
peace, and the waves will not rage and swell,
and there shall be safety on the waves of the
sea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the people did as Guido said. They took
the blood of a lamb, and sprinkled the nest and
the rock therewith. Then passed the emperor
and all his people to the Holy Land, and returned
in peace and safety. And the emperor
did as he had promised unto Guido, and rewarded
the perfect servant with great riches,
promoting him to high honor among the people.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I confess myself conquered,” said Henry Herbert, as
soon as the story was concluded. “Some points in the
allegory are clear, as the way to the Holy Land, and the
sprinkling of the blood of the Lamb, but the rest are
beyond my discovering.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The explanation,” said Herbert, “is undoubtedly
more recondite than any we have read as yet. The great
emperor is our Father in heaven; the three blows on his
gate are prayer, self-denial, charity; by these three any
one may become his faithful servant. Guido is a poor
Christian, by baptism made his servant. His first service
is to serve his God, and to prepare the heart for virtue.
His second duty is to watch; ‘for he knoweth not the
day nor the hour when the Son of Man cometh.’ His
third task is to taste of repentance, which was good to
the saints who are departed, is good to such of us as it
brings to salvation, and will be good to all in the last
day. The fourth duty is to invite Christ’s enemies to be
his friends, and to come to the banquet of his love for he
‘came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>The fire that burneth without smoke, is the fire
of charity, which burneth free of all ill-will and bad
feeling. The way to the Holy Land is our course heavenward.
We are to sail over our sea, the world; in the
midst of which standeth our rock, even our heart, on
which the holy bird of God’s Spirit resteth. The seven
eggs are the gifts of the Spirit. When the Spirit leaves
us, the Devil hasteth to defile our hearts; but the blood
of the Lamb which was slain for us, even our Saviour,
will ward off the attack of our enemy, so long as we are
sprinkled therewith.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The explanation is characteristic of the age,” said
Herbert. “What then,” rejoined Lathom, “will you
say to the moral drawn by these writers from the
wonders that Pliny believed in, without seeing, and Sir
John de Mandeville tried to persuade the world he
believed in, from seeing?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What,” said Thompson, “the Anthropophagi, and
men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No creature is so monstrous, no fable so incredible,
but that the monkish writers could give it a moral form,
and extract from its crudities and quiddities some moral
or religious lesson.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“They believed in the words of the song,” said
Thompson—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Reason sure will always bring</div>
      <div class='line'>Something out of every thing.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Pliny’s dog-headed race,” said Lathom, “whom Sir
John places in the island of Macumeran, and at the
same time gives to them a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi</span></i> pope for a king, who
says three hundred prayers per diem before he either eats
or drinks, were naturally regarded by the middle-age
writers as symbolical and priestly preachers of faithful
hearts and frugal habits; whilst of those other islanders,
who ‘have but one eye, and that in the middest of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>front, and eat their flesh and fish raw,’ the monk says,
‘These be they that have the eye of prayer.’ The Astomes
who have no mouths, ‘are all hairie over the
whole bodie, yet clothed with soft cotton and downe,
that cometh from the leaves of trees, and live only on
aire, and by the smelling of sweet odors, which they
draw through their nose-thrills,’ are the abstemious
of this world, who die of the sin of gluttony, even as an
Astome by the accidental inhalation of bad odor. Humility
is signified by the absence of the head, and the
placing of the face in the breast; and a tendency to sin
is foreshadowed by a desire and habit of walking on
all fours, or pride by short noses and goat’s feet. The
Mandevillean islanders, who had flat faces without noses,
and two round holes for their eyes, and thought whatsoever
they saw to be good, were earth’s foolish ones; as
those foul men, who have their lips so great, that when
they sleep in the sun they cover all their face therewith,
are the just men, the salt of the earth.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One would as soon dream of allegorizing the Sciapodes
of Aristophanes, or Homer’s Cranes and Pigmies,”
said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And so the monk has,” said Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What, the old Greek’s parasol-footed people, of whom
Mandeville says with such gravity, ‘There be in Ethiope
such men as have but one foot, and they go so fast that it
is a great marvel; and that is a large foot, for the
shadow thereof covereth the body from sun or rain,
when they lie upon their back’?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Both Aristophanes and his follower would doubtless
be as surprised in learning that their sciapodes were
allegorical of the charitable of this world, as Homer
would in discovering in his crane-fighting pigmies those
mortals who begin well but cease to do well before
they attain perfection; or in their neighbors who
boast of six hands, and despise clothes in favor of long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>hair, and live in rivers, the hardworking and laborious
among men.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The last is decidedly the most intelligible,” remarked
Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The reason of the explanation is not always clear,”
replied Lathom; “it is not very easy to decide why those
who have six fingers and six toes are the unpolluted, and
why virtuous men are represented by a race of women
with bald heads and beards flowing to their breast; nor
is it very clear that virtue is well represented by a double
allowance of eyes. But one curiosity remains—the beautiful
men of Europe who boast a crane’s head, neck, and
beak. These, says the author of the Gesta, represent
judges, who should have long necks and beaks, <i>that what
the heart thinks, may be long before it reach the mouth</i>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“That reminds me of long Jack Bannister,” said
Thompson, “who was always five minutes after every
one else in laughing at a joke, as it took that extra time
for it to travel from his ears to his midriff, and then back
again to his mouth.”</p>

<p class='c012'>And so the evening ended with a laugh.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Progress of Fiction from the East to the West—The
Early Christians—The Monks—The Spanish Arabians—The
Crusades—<span class='sc'>The Knight and the King of
Hungary</span>—The English Gesta.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“Admitting the East as the immediate source of
fiction,” said Henry Herbert, when they were
met once more, “you must still regard the Spanish Arabians
as the great disseminators of those extravagant
inventions which were so peculiar to their romantic and
creative genius.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Less, perhaps, than many other sources. The absence
of Moorish subjects from the earliest tales of
chivalry, if it proves no more, at least shows how prevalent
the tales of Charlemagne and his peers were in the
eighth century, that a nation of conquerors could do little
to infect them with legends of their own.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How and when, then, Lathom, would you introduce
Eastern invention?” asked Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I would refer it to much earlier ages, to the earliest
of the Christian centuries, and contend that it was
gradual, and therefore more natural; was the production
of times and of ages, not the sudden birth and growth of
one age; gradually augmenting until it attained to full
and perfect stature.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Still,” rejoined Herbert, “we want the means by
which this knowledge of Eastern fable was introduced.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some share may be due to the return of those primitive
Christians who sought refuge in the East from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>persecutions of the pagan rulers of the West. Their
minds were well prepared to adopt the fervent expressions
of the East, and their condition prevented them
from investigating the tales they heard. Hence, in the
lives of these saints they were as ready to interweave the
prodigies of another land, hoping, perhaps, to conciliate
the minds of the Eastern Oriental to the tenets of their
faith, by introducing fictitious incidents of Oriental
structure, as, to conciliate the heathen, they placed their
gods and goddesses in the Christian temple, dignifying
them with a new name, and serving them with novel
ceremonies.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Admitting the probability, still your machinery seems
deficient.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is but a portion of my machinery. Much more
was due to the clouds of monks, who, during the third
and fourth centuries, wandered over the face of the
habitable world.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When Gibbon admits that the progress of monachism
was co-extensive with that of Christianity,” suggested
Frederick Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The disciples of Antony,” said Herbert, “we are assured,
spread themselves beyond the tropic, over the
Christian empire of Ethiopia.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Their distribution was universal,” said Lathom;
“every province, almost every city of the empire, had its
ascetics; they feared no dangers, and deemed no seas,
mountains, or deserts a barrier to their progress.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The roving character of the monks, therefore,” says
the last translator of the Gesta, “is another link of the
chain by which I introduce Oriental fiction into the West;
and it is utterly impossible (maturely weighing the habits
and propensities of this class of people) that they
should not have picked up and retained the floating traditions
of the countries through which they passed.
Some of the early romances, as well as the legends of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>the saints, were undoubtedly fabricated in the deep
silence of the cloister. Both frequently sprung from the
warmth of fancy which religious seclusion is so well
tended to nourish; but the former were adorned with
foreign embellishments.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did it ever occur to you,” said Thompson, “that the
story of Ulysses and Circe bears a wondrous likeness to
that of Beder the prince of Persia and Giahame princess
of Samandal, and that the voyages of Sindbad afford the
counterpart of the Cyclops of the Odysee?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It would be but consistent with the reported travels
of Homer, to allow an Eastern origin to a portion of his
fable,” said Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“After your banished Christians and roving monks,”
said Herbert, “you would admit the Spanish Arabians.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As one means, certainly,” replied Lathom; “and
after them the Crusaders.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It were almost superfluous,” rejoined Herbert, “to
allude to the Crusades as further sources of romantic
and didactic fiction. No one will dispute their right to a
place in the system. About the period of the third crusade
this kind of writing was at its height.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Undoubtedly,” rejoined Lathom, “that age was the
full tide of chivalry. Twenty years elapsed between
that and the fourth and fifth expeditions into the east;
and nearly a generation passed before, for the sixth
and the last time, the wealth and blood of Europe was
poured upon the plains of the East. Enough of money
and life had been now spent to satisfy the most enthusiastic
of the crusading body, and to check, if not to stem,
the tide of popular feeling which had formerly run so
strong in favor of the restoration of the sepulchre and
the holy city to the guardianship of the faithful. Time
was now at last beginning to allay the Anti-Saracenic
passion. With the decline of these remarkable expeditions
romantic fiction began to be regarded. For though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>originally extraneous and independent, romantic fictions
had of late years become incorporated with chivalry and
its institutions, and, with them, they naturally fell into
decay.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come, come, we must break off this discussion,” said
Thompson, “or else we shall have no time to judge of
Lathom’s performance this evening.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The story I selected to begin with is one replete with
eccentricity, and peculiarly characteristic of this age; it
is entitled</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“THE KNIGHT AND THE KING OF HUNGARY.”</h3>

<p class='c014'>There was a merry feast in the palace of
Philonimus, the emperor of Rome, and
his fair child, the maiden Aglae, sat by his side,
whilst a brave knight, that loved the maiden
dearly, sat on the other hand of the emperor.
For the knight was bound for Palestine, to aid in
rescuing the holy city from the power of the infidels
and the emperor held a high festival in
honor of that knight.</p>

<p class='c007'>The feast was over in the hall, and the knight
led the maiden from beside her father’s throne
to the floor of the hall, and danced with her,
whilst the king’s minstrels played a measure.</p>

<p class='c007'>And as he danced, the knight talked with the
lady, and the lady talked with the knight, and
often sighed she when he spoke of his voyage
to the Holy Land, and the great deeds he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>perform for the glory of God, and the love of
the fair lady. Then said the knight: “Lady,
fair lady! to-morrow’s dawn sees me on my way
to Palestine, and for seven years I bind myself
to fight for the holy city. Plight me, dearest,
thy troth, that this seven years you take no
other husband, and I will plight thee my troth
that for that time I will take no wife; and if
this day seven years I come not again, then art
thou free from thy promise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lady was pleased with the words of the
knight, and they vowed their vow, the one to
the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then sailed the knight for Palestine, and for
years they wist not where he was. At length,
the king of Hungary came to the emperor’s
court, and he looked on the beauty of Aglae,
and sought her of her father for his queen.
And the emperor was glad; for the king was
a great and good king. Then said he: “So be
it, if my daughter consent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Aglae bowed her head, when the king of
Hungary spoke to her, and said: “Oh lord, the
king, I am not free to be thy wife; for lo, these
six years past I vowed to marry no man, and lo,
one year more remains of my vow; until the
end of which, I cannot accept the honor of my
lord the king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then said the father: “Since thou hast so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>vowed, I will not break thy vow. Wait then,
my lord, yet one year, and then my daughter
shall be thy bride.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the king of Hungary returned to his kingdom.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c007'>Aglae sat at her chamber window, and looked
out upon the road that led towards her father’s
palace. “Alas, alas!” she said, “it wants but one
day to complete the seven years of my vow. To-morrow,
my love promised to be with me again
from the Holy Land. To-morrow, the king of
Hungary comes to claim me. Ah me, what
shall I do, if my love comes not, I must be the
king’s bride”; and she bent her face on her
hand, and wept sorely.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the day drew near, the king of Hungary
prepared to seek his bride. A great company
was gathered together, and many wagons of
presents were prepared to accompany the king.
But when he saw them, and how slowly they
journeyed, he left all his company, and went
his way alone, eager to claim Aglae as his bride,
so soon as the seven years were ended. The
king was royally arrayed in purple, and his
steed was clothed in gorgeous trappings. Now,
as he drew nigh to Rome, a knight rode after
him, who was covered from head to foot in a
long black cloak, and bore on his shoulder a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>white embroidered cross. “Hail, Sir Knight,”
said the king, “whither travellest thou; what
news from the Holy Land?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To Rome, my lord,” rejoined the knight,
halting his steed alongside of the king’s, “the
Cross has gained the victory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thither, too, do I travel, Sir Knight; I am
the king of Hungary, I go to seek my bride, the
emperor’s fair daughter; I pray thee bear me
company on the road.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The knight acceded to the king’s proposal,
and as they journeyed, they talked of the holy
war in Palestine, and rejoiced that the city of
the holy sepulchre was free from the power of
the Saracens. As they thus talked together, the
sky became cloudy, the wind howled through the
woods, and the rain fell so fast, that the king’s
apparel was wet through.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” said the knight, “ye have done
foolishly in that ye have not brought your house
with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My house, Sir Knight! how meanest thou?
my house is large and broad, made of stones and
mortar; how should I bring with me my house;
thou art beside thyself, Sir Knight!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the knight said nothing until they came to
the bank of a broad stream, into which the king,
being out of humor, plunged his horse, at the
same time striking his spurs deeply into him, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>he missed the ford, and would have been drowned
but for the knight’s help.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” said the knight, when they were
safe on the river’s bank, “thou shouldest have
brought thy bridge with thee.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My bridge,” said the king, “how strangely
thou speakest, Sir Knight; my bridge is made
of stones and mortar, and is half a mile long,
and yet thou sayest, why have I not my bridge?
Thou art foolish, Sir Knight!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps,” replied the knight, “my folly
may turn thee to wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And as they rode on, the king asked of the
knight what hour of the day it was.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For those that are hungry,” replied the
knight, “it is time to eat; dismount therefore,
my lord, and honor me by partaking of the
food I have with me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So they both sat down under a tree, and ate
of the food that was in the knight’s wallet, and
drank of the clear stream that ran beside them.
When their meal was finished, and they were
once more mounted, the knight said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“O king, why didst not thou bring with thee
thy father and thy mother?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father, Sir Knight, is dead, and my
mother is old and cannot travel; how then
could I bring them? Verily, thou art the most
foolish man that I did ever meet with.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“That is as it may be,” said the knight with a
smile, “every thing is judged by its end. Now,
O king, farewell! I may not ride with thee to the
emperor’s palace, thither lies thy road, farewell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But stay, Sir Knight,” said the king,
“whither ridest thou then?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Seven years ago, I left a net in a place, and
now I go to see. If I find it not broken, then
will I take it home, and keep it, as a precious
jewel; if it be broken, I will leave it to thee. O
king, once more, farewell.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So speaking, the knight turned away from
the high road, and went by a shorter way
toward Rome, to the emperor’s palace. The
king rode upon the highway. Now, as the
king drew near to Rome, one of the emperor’s
servants met him, and went and told the emperor,
how that the King of Hungary was riding
all alone towards the city, and was wet and
weary with his journey. Then the emperor set
out to meet the king, and received him royally,
and took his wet clothes off him, and clothed
him with his own imperial robes. Then the
trumpets sounded for dinner, and the emperor
and the king descended to the hall; but Aglae
was not there, for she kept her chamber, and
her father refused her not, as it was the last day
of her seven years’ vow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brother,” said the emperor, as soon as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>meats were removed from the table, “I pray
thee tell me of thy journey.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the king told him how he left his own
company to come after, and fell in with the Crusader
on his journey, and how he was dressed,
and what he said as they rode together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surely,” said the emperor, “that knight
was a wise man: for the house of which he
spoke was thy cloak; the bridge was thy squire,
that should have ridden before thee to try the
depth of the stream; and what was thy father
and mother save bread and wine, which thou
shouldest have brought with thee? But why
did he leave thee?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“When we came where two roads met,” rejoined
the king, “he left me, saying, that seven
years since he left a net in a private place, and
he went to see whether it were broken or not,
that he might treasure it as a jewel if it were
unbroken, and if broken, resign it to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the emperor cried with a loud voice,
“Ho! my knights and servants, go ye to my
daughter’s chamber.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the knights and servants went, and found
not the lady, for her lover had stolen her away
while the kings dined.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even so, as I expected,” said the emperor;
“brother, the knight’s folly has taught thee
wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Yea, brother,” rejoined the king, sorrowfully,
“truly said the knight, every deed is judged by
its end.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So the king returned to Hungary ashamed;
and when the knight and the maiden returned to
her father, his heart yearned toward her, and he
wept over her, and received them with joy.</p>

<p class='c015'>“This last tale,” said Lathom, as soon as he had concluded
his manuscripts, “comes not from the old Latin
books, but from what is called the English Gesta.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“An imitation of the original, I suppose,” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“So thought that antiquarian, Mr. Douce,” replied
Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it not natural, that a work so remarkable as this
old Latin Gesta seems to have been, should have stimulated
some person to compose a similar work for this
country?” suggested Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“If the English version was not intended for the same
work as the original, it is difficult to account for the
striking identity between the stories in each of the
Gesta; whilst the difference between the two works is in
no respect greater than is consistent with that great
latitude which the old transcribers and translators gave
themselves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is, therefore, Lathom, in your opinion as much an
original work as Donne’s Satires modernized by Pope,
or Horace’s Art of Poetry translated by Roscommon,”
said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, or as Dr. Johnson’s version of the Tenth Satire
of Juvenal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must be thinking of adjourning,” said Herbert, as
the college clock began to strike eight.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“Or we may find ourselves inscribed among St. Peter’s
madmen,” said Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“St. Peter’s madmen—who were they?” exclaimed
Herbert and Thompson together.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Five men St. Peter deemed to be madmen,” rejoined
their host. “One ate the sand of the sea so greedily that
it ran out of his mouth: verily he was the covetous man
of this world. The next madman stood over a pit filled
with sulphur and pitch, and strove to inhale the noxious
vapor that rose from the burning mass; he was the
glutton and the debauchee. A third lay on a burning
furnace, and endeavored to catch the sparks that rose
from it, that he might feast on them: for he was rich,
and would have fed on gold, though it would have been
his death. The next lunatic sat on the pinnacle of the
temple, with his mouth open to catch the wind, for he
was a hypocrite; whilst the last madman devoured every
finger and toe of his own he could get into his mouth,
and laughed at others; for he was a calumniator of the
good, and devoured his own kind.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And the sixth stayed up to read in a Christmas vacation,”
suggested Thompson.</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>THE THREE BLACK CROWS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Once upon a time, there lived two brothers,
the one a cleric, the other a layman.
The former was always saying that no woman
could keep a secret, and as his brother was
married, he bade him test the truth of this assertion
on his own wife. The layman agreed;
and one night, when they were alone, he said,
with a sorrowful face, to his spouse:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear wife, a most dreadful secret hangs
over me; oh that I could divulge it to you; but
no, I dare not; you never could keep it, and, if
once divulged, my reputation is gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fear not, love,” rejoined the wife; “are we
not one body and one mind? Is not your advantage
my benefit, and your injury my loss?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, then,” said the husband, “when I left
my room this morning a deadly sickness came
upon me, and after many a pang, a huge black
crow flew out of my mouth, and, winging its
way from the room, left me in fear and trembling.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“Is it possible?” asked the wife; “yet why
should you fear, my life? be thankful rather
that you have been freed from so noxious and
troublesome an occupant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Here the conversation ended. As soon as it
was day, up got the wife, with her thoughts full
of the black crow, and hastened to a neighbor’s
house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear friend,” said she, “can I trust you
with a secret?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As with your life,” rejoined the confidante.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, such a marvellous accident happened
to my husband!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What? what?” asked the anxious friend.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only last night, he felt deadly sick, and,
after a great deal of pain, two black crows flew
out of his mouth, and took wing from the
room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Away went the wife home, with her mind disburthened
of the awful secret; whilst her friend
hastened to her next neighbor, and retailed the
story, only with the addition of one more crow.
The next edition of the legend rose to four; and
at last, when the story had gone round the gossips
of the village, a flock of forty crows were
reported to have flown from the poor man’s
mouth; and there were not a few who remembered
seeing the black legion on the wing from
the man’s window. The consequence of all this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>was, that the poor husband found himself saddled
with the very questionable reputation of a
wizard, and was obliged to call together the
village, and explain to them the true origin of
the fable. On this his wife and her confidantes
were overwhelmed with ridicule and shame, and
the men of the village were the more impressed
with the truth of the cleric’s maxim.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Did the old monk attempt a further interpretation of
his ungallant fable?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Undoubtedly,” replied Lathom. “The unfortunate
husband typified the worldly man, who, thinking to do
one foolish act without offence, falls into a thousand
errors, and has, at last, to purge his conscience by a
public confession.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let us now pass on to Shakspeare’s plagiarisms,”
said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Improvements—new settings of old jewels, which
only heighten their lustre—not plagiarisms,” replied
Lathom. “King Lear dates back to the Gesta. Theodosius
of Rome occupies the place of the British king;
his child Theodosia is Shakspeare’s Cordelia.”</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>THE EMPEROR OF ROME AND HIS THREE DAUGHTERS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Theodosius was emperor of Rome, mighty
in power, and wise in counsel. He had
no son, but three daughters, whom he loved exceedingly.
Now when they were come of full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>age, the emperor called unto him the eldest and
said: “How much lovest thou me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“More than mine ownself,” replied the eldest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is good,” rejoined her father; “thou shalt
be rewarded for thy love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So he married her unto a neighboring king
of great power and wealth. Then he sent for
his second daughter, and asked her the same
question.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even as I do myself,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this the emperor was well pleased, and he
kissed his child, and said: “I will reward thee
for this thy love.” So he married her unto one
of the greatest nobles of his realm.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last he sent for his youngest daughter, and
when she was come into his presence, he asked
her likewise how much she loved him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Theodosia bowed her head, and bent her knee
to her father, as she mildly replied: “Even as
my father deserveth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then was the emperor hurt with her reply,
and he said: “Lovest thou me no more than
this? thy reward shall be less than thy sisters.”
So he married her unto a poor but good lord,
who was one of the lesser nobles of his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Time passed away, misfortune came upon the
emperor, and his kingdom was all but taken
from him by the king of Egypt. Then said he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>to himself: “I will appeal to my children.” So
he wrote to his eldest daughter for aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord, the king, I have here a letter from
my father,” said the eldest daughter to her husband,
“he asketh help of us in his misfortunes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it not just that we should aid him?” replied
the king; “we will raise an army, and go
and fight for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, my lord,” rejoined his wife, “consider
the expense; send my father five knights to
keep him company in his wanderings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alas, alas!” said the aged emperor when he
read his eldest child’s answer, “in her was my
chief trust; she, that loved me more than herself,
hath done only this much, how then shall I
trust the other two?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then wrote he to the second daughter, who,
when she read her father’s letter, advised her
husband to grant him food, lodging, and raiment,
during the time of his need. The emperor
was sore grieved at this reply. “Now
have I tried my two daughters, and have found
them wanting, let me try the third,” so he wrote
to his youngest child.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the messenger brought the emperor’s
letter to Theodosia, she wept sorely as she read
how that her father was driven from his capital,
and was become a wanderer in his own kingdom.
Then went she to her husband and said:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Oh, my dear lord, by thy love towards me,
succor me in this great distress; my father
is driven from his capital by the king of Egypt,
and even now wanders up and down his own
kingdom, homeless and unattended.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As thou wiliest, Theodosia,” replied the
noble, “so will I do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gather then a great army, raise again my
father’s banner, and go, my lord, fight for my
father’s throne, and under God’s blessing thou
shalt conquer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gladly the noble obeyed the wishes of his
wife; gladly did he summon his retainers and
friends, and raise the royal standard. His
example was all that was required; numbers
flocked to the royal standard, for they wished
well to the emperor, but lacked a leader. Then
led he his forces against the king of Egypt, and
long and fierce was the battle; but at length
the emperor’s friends prevailed, the Egyptian
was driven from the land, and the emperor
reseated on his throne. It was a happy day for
his people when Theodosius reascended his
throne: round him stood all his nobles, and on
his right hand his youngest daughter, and on his
left her noble husband, to whom he was indebted
for his restoration. Before his footstool
stood his other children and their husbands,
and sought to do him homage. But the emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>forbade them, and turning to his nobles
he said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The child that loved me but as I deserved,
hath succored me in this my time of trouble;
the twain that professed to love me more abundantly,
have failed in the trial God ordained to
them and to me. I pray ye, my nobles and
knights, to ratify this my wish. When I die,
let the kingdom pass to her and to her husband,
for she succored her father and her
country; but for these other two, let them go
hence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the nobles and knights with one accord
said: “It is well said; be it so.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“Is the Merchant of Venice among the list of plots
borrowed from the Gesta?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is inscribed as a debtor to two tales: to the one, for
the incident of the bond; to the other, for that of the three
caskets.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I thought,” said Frederick Thompson, “the incident
of Shylock’s bond came from the Italian of Fiorentino, a
novelist of the fourteenth century.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is found there, and is generally translated from his
work in the preface to the play, but is also found, in
almost the same words, in the English Gesta, in the story
of Selestinus, the Wise Emperor, who had a Fair
Daughter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You claim also the incident of the Three Caskets.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I claim one form of it for my old monks in the story
of The Carpenter and the Owner of the Lost Treasure,
and another form in the tale found in the English Gesta
of the emperor Anselmus.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>“What is the legend of the carpenter?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He is supposed to have found some gold, and to
be doubting whether he should restore it to its owner,
whom chance has led to the carpenter’s cottage in his inquiries
after his lost treasure. To satisfy his mind he
makes three cakes; one he fills with earth, another with
bones, and the third has a piece of gold within it. On
giving his guest the choice, the traveller is led by the
weight to choose the one full of earth, and claiming
a portion of that containing bones, should the first not
satisfy his hunger, he gives the lightest to his host.
Thus convinced that the man does not deserve his lost
treasure, the carpenter drives him from his hut, and distributes
the money to the poor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is but a slight hint,” said Herbert; “the choice
is exactly contrary to that of the play.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In the latter story, whether original or copied, the
choice is identical with that in the Merchant of Venice.
The moral the writer intended to read was the deceitfulness
of outward appearances.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The old proverb,” suggested Thompson, “all is not
gold that glitters.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will read now the form of the story in the English
Gesta.”</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>THE TALE OF THE THREE CASKETS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Centuries have passed since Anselmus
reigned in Rome, whose empress was the
fair daughter of the king of Jerusalem, and gracious
in the sight of every man. Long had they
lived happily together, but were not blest with a
child, to comfort their lives, and to inherit their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>power and honors. And it came to pass that as
the emperor walked in his garden, he bethought
him of the constant wars of the king of Ampluy,
his neighbor, who ceased not to trouble him,
because he had no son to defend his dominions.
And as he walked and mused, he looked on the
moon, and fell into a trance, and dreamed a
dream, how that the morning was very bright,
and the moon looked paler on the one side than
on the other. And then there flew towards him
a bird of two colors; two beasts came and stood
by the bird, and warmed the little creature with
their heat. And lo, other beasts, mighty and
terrible, came, and bowed themselves before the
little bird, and went their way; and then followed
these many other birds of bright plumage
and sweet song, and they sang pleasantly, and
waked the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anselmus was troubled with his dream, and
he called for his wise men, his nobles, and his
counsellors, and told them of his vision, and
sought from them the interpretation of his
dream. When the wise men, the nobles, and
the counsellors had considered of these things,
they spoke cheerfully unto the king.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sire,” said they, “the vision betokens good
to the empire, its glory shall be clearer than it
is. The loss of color in the moon prefigures the
loss of strength to our empress when a child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>is born unto you. The little bird is this child,
our prince. The two beasts that warmed him,
are the good and the great of our empire, who
will give of their substance to sustain and cherish
their prince. And whilst the other nations,
mighty and strong, shall bow down before him,
as the beasts did in the vision, so shall our people
rejoice and sing with exceeding joy, as the
birds sang sweetly and pleasantly in thy dream.
Such, O king, is the interpretation of the
vision.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Exceeding glad was the emperor at these
words, and his joy was the more increased when
a son was born unto him, according to the words
of the wise men.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the king of Ampluy heard of the birth
of the prince, he was afraid, remembering the
wrong he had done to Anselmus, and foreseeing
the vengeance he would experience from the
prince when he should come of age and lead
the armies of his father. So he turned his mind
to peace, and wrote humbly unto the emperor.
When Anselmus read the king’s letter he replied
in peaceful terms, and promised him his
protection and friendship, if he would give securities
for his conduct, and acknowledge his
sovereignty by a small tribute.</p>

<p class='c007'>King Ampluy read the emperor’s letter to his
council, and prayed their counsel as touching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the matter. Then said the counsellors: “The
emperor’s words are good, and to be obeyed.
As for the surety that he asks; is there not to
our lord one daughter, a maiden fair and goodly
withal, and is there not to the emperor one son,
a noble prince? Contract, therefore, marriage
between thy child and his, that there may be a
perpetual peace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king obeyed the advice of his counsellors;
he wrote their words unto the emperor,
who received them gladly, and the marriage
contract was signed.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the king sent his child by sea to the emperor’s
court. The ship was a great ship, with fair
masts, and able pilots, glittering with gay pennants
and costly ornaments, and it bore a
goodly company of nobles, knights, and titled
dames, with many and rich presents to do honor
to the marriage of the maiden and the prince.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it came to pass that as they sailed towards
Rome, a storm rose, and drove the ship hither
and thither over the waves, until she brake
against a rock, and sank into the waters. And
all they that were in her were drowned, save the
daughter of the king, who put her trust in God
and was saved. At length the storm abated,
and the ship, broken and helpless, rose from
beneath the waves and floated. But, lo, a great
whale followed after the ship, to swallow up it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>and the maiden. So the maiden struck a light,
and lighted a fire, that terrified the whale, which
dared not to approach the ship for fear of the
fire. At break of dawn, she fell asleep, for she
was weary of watching; and as she slept, the
fire ceased for want of fuel, and the whale came
and devoured the maiden.</p>

<p class='c007'>When she awoke, darkness was around her
on every side, for she was in the belly of the
whale; but she feared not, but struck with the
stone until the fire came, and thrust with a
knife into the sides of the whale, that he made
towards the shore, for he felt that he was
wounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>In that country dwelt a noble, a servant of the
emperor, who for his recreation walked on the
shore the time the whale was making towards
the land. When he saw the monster, he turned
homeward, summoned his servants, and returning
to the shore fought with the whale until it
was sore wounded and like to die. And even
as they smote the fish, the maiden cried with a
loud voice from within the whale:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mercy, gentle friends; mercy on me, for I
am a king’s daughter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wondering greatly at these words, the noble
hauled the fish ashore, and opening the side of
the whale, released the lady from her prison.
And when he heard her story, he pitied her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>sore, and took her to his own castle to comfort
her until he could convey her to the court of the
emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Anselmus heard of the maiden’s safety,
he rejoiced greatly, and came to her, and had
compassion on her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fair maiden,” said the emperor, “sorely as
thou hast been tried, and great woe as thou hast
suffered for the love of my son, still must thou
endure another trial ere thou be proclaimed
worthy to be his wife! Let the caskets be
brought hither.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the king’s servants brought three caskets.
The first was of pure gold, richly set about
with precious stones; but within was full of dead
men’s bones. On this was inscribed: “<span class='fss'>WHOSO
CHOOSETH ME SHALL FIND WHAT HE DESERVETH</span>.”
The second casket was made of fine
silver, filled with earth and worms; and its inscription
was: “<span class='fss'>WHOSO CHOOSETH ME SHALL
FIND THAT WHICH HIS NATURE DESIRETH</span>.”
But the last vessel was made of lead, and without
was dull and useless; but within were
precious stones. On this casket was written:
“<span class='fss'>WHOSO CHOOSETH ME SHALL FIND THAT
WHICH GOD HATH DISPOSED FOR HIM</span>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then said the emperor: “Maiden, look on
these three vessels, they be rich vessels; if thou
choose that wherein is profit to thee and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>others, then thou shalt marry my son; but if
thou choose that in which is no profit to thee or
to others, then in peace return to thy father.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king’s daughter lifted up her hands to
God, and prayed for his grace in the hour of her
trial. First she looked upon the golden casket,
and as she read the words of its inscription, she
said: “Full, precious, and gay, art thou, O
casket, but I know not what is within; therefore,
dear lord, I choose not this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then looked she on the silver casket, and its
inscription, “Whoso chooseth me shall find
that which his nature desireth.” “Alas!” said
the maiden, “I know not what is herein; but
this I know, that I shall therein find that which
my nature desireth, even the wickedness of the
flesh. Casket of silver, I will have none of
thee.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lastly she looked on the leaden casket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor art thou, O casket, to look upon, and
yet thy inscription giveth comfort; thou promisest,
‘that which God hath disposed’; and God
never disposeth any thing harmful; by his permission,
I take thee, O casket.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then cried the emperor: “Well done, thou
fair and good maiden; open thy casket, for it is
full of precious gifts. Well hast thou chosen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then appointed he the day of the wedding;
and the maiden and the prince were married
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>with great solemnity, and with much honor
among all the nation lived they until their
lives’ end.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your title is, I think, perfected,” said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“And yet there are those that can put in an earlier
claim,” said Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“An earlier claim; how far back then would you
carry it?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nearly to the eighth century; one link between the
East and the West. Damascenus, the Greek monk, who
wrote the spiritual romance of Barlaam and Josaphat,
makes the hermit Barlaam, late the king of a brother
monarch, who commanded four chests to be made, two
covered with gold, and two overlaid with pitch, and
bound with common cords. In the former he placed
dead men’s bones, in the latter jewels, gold, and precious
ointments. He then gave his courtiers the choice; and
when they chose the golden coffers, the king said: ‘I
anticipated your decision, for ye look with the eyes of
sense. To discern the good or evil that lies within, we
must look with the eyes of the mind.’ Then he opened
the chests, and showed his courtiers their error.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is that kind of tale that would be most acceptable
to all writers,” said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The general use they have made of it, in one form or
other, is evidence of its popularity. Boccaccio has dressed
it up under the story of The King and Signor Rogiero,
and Gower has versified it, filling the unlucky chest with
earth, stone, and rubbish, instead of men’s bones. To-morrow
evening, I will give you some more instances of
this kind of conversion of the old monks’ stories.”</p>

Poet’s Improvements—<span class='sc'>Fulgentius and

Claims of the Old Writers on the New.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“On what nation have the antiquaries endeavored
to fix the authorship of these tales?” replied Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here doctors disagree: Wharton contends for a Poitevin
prior of the Benedictine convent of St. Eloi at Paris:
whilst Douce argues for a German origin, because in the
moralization attached to one tale there is a German
proverb, and in another the names of some dogs are
partly German, partly Saxon.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Might not this arise from the pen of a translator or
adapter?” suggested Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“More than probably it did. The fact of the scenes in
one or two of the tales being laid in England, may tend
to show that the copy in which they appear was prefaced
by a writer of that country: as the introduction of the
German proverb would lead us to suppose that the editor
of that copy was a German.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is it not probable,” said Herbert, “that this book may
have been a mere collection of the popular tales of the
age in which it was written, confined to no particular
country, drawn from every available source; thus leaving
to the reputed author, the task of arrangement and
transcription, rather than of origination?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“It is now useless to endeavor to determine this
point: as in the history of fiction it is far more easy to
upset prior theories, than to set up new ones,” replied
Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whose conversions, as you kindly denominate them,
do you propose illustrating this evening?” asked
Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Parnell and Schiller,” rejoined Lathom, “The Lay of
the Hermit, and The Ballad of Fridolin. We will begin
with Parnell.”</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>THE ANGEL AND THE HERMIT.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Far in a wild, unknown to public view, in a
cell which he had hollowed out with his
own hands on the edge of an open down, from
youth to age a reverend hermit grew. The
neighboring lord’s shepherd was wont to feed
his sheep on short but sweet pasture of the hermit’s
down.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day the poor shepherd, fatigued with
watching, fell asleep, and a robber came and
stole the lord’s flock. When he awoke, he discovered
the loss, and stoutly maintained that
the sheep had been stolen, but the lord would
not believe the shepherd, and commanded him
to be put to death.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hermit saw the deed, and thus communed
with himself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merciful God, seest thou what this man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>hath done, and how the innocent suffers for the
guilty? Why permittest thou these things? If
injustice is to triumph, why remain I here?
Verily I will re-enter the world, and do as other
men do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Impressed with these thoughts, the hermit
left his cell, and wandered back to the world
and the abodes of men, and on his way, an
angel, sent from God, met him, and being in the
form of a traveller, he joined himself to the hermit,
and asked him which way he journeyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the city that lieth before us,” rejoined
the hermit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will accompany you,” replied his companion;
“I am an angel sent from God, to
be the associate of your wanderings.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So they walked onwards to the city. When
they entered the gates, they sought the house of
a soldier, and entreated him, by God’s love, to
give them harborage during the night. The
veteran complied with cheerfulness, and spared
not of the best of his substance, for the entertainment
of the travellers. The hospitable
soldier had but one child, an infant in the
cradle. And so it happened, that when supper
was ended, the veteran lighted the guests to his
best chamber, and the angel and the hermit retired
to rest. About midnight the hermit awoke,
and saw the angel rise from the bed, enter the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>chamber where the infant slept, and strangle it
with his own hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surely,” said the hermit to himself, “this
cannot be an angel of God; did not the good
soldier give us every thing that we required?
and now, lo, the only child that he had, is slain
by this, his guest.” And yet he feared to reprove
his companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the morning, the hermit and the angel
arose, and sought a neighboring city, where
they found a hospitable reception in the house
of one of its chief persons. This man had a
valuable drinking cup of gold, which the angel
purloined during the night, but the hermit yet
was silent, for he feared more than he doubted.
On the morrow the travellers continued their
journey, and on their way they came to a river,
over which was a bridge thrown. They ascended
the bridge, and met, midway, a poor and
aged pilgrim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My friend,” said the angel to the old man,
“show us the way to yonder city.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the pilgrim turned him to show the angel
the road, he seized him by the shoulders, and
cast the old man headlong into the river that
ran beneath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alas, alas!” cried the hermit to himself,
“it is the Evil One himself. Why? what evil
had the poor man done?” and yet, with all his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>thoughts, the hermit feared to give utterance to
his fears.</p>

<p class='c007'>About the hour of vespers, the travellers
reached another city, in which they sought
shelter for the night; but the master of the
house refused them rudely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the love of heaven,” said the angel,
“spare us of thy house for shelter against the
wolves and other wild beasts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That,” rejoined the man, “is my pigsty,
lie ye there, if it so please ye; for ye come
no other whither.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Necessity,” replied the angel, “forces us to
accept your ungracious offer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the morrow, the angel called the host, and
said, “Friend, I give you this goblet,” presenting
to him the cup he had stolen from his
former host.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said the hermit, “know I that this
is no angel; doth he not reward evil for good,
and good for evil? No longer will I travel
with you; fare thee well, I commend thee to
God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear friend,” rejoined the angel, “hear me
ere you depart. Whilst thou wert in thy hermitage,
the lord of the flock unjustly slew his
careless but innocent servant. For his innocence
he will be in a fit state to enter another
world; but had he lived, he would have fallen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>into sin, and died before repentance could have
followed. Eternal punishment shall follow
them who stole the sheep; but repentance and
acts of faith shall repair the error which the
owner of the flock committed in his ignorance.
Truly the soldier was hospitable, but he loved
his son overmuch; ere then, he was charitable
and merciful, but on the birth of his child
he grew parsimonious and covetous, that he
might leave a fortune to his son. With his
child’s death hath returned his Christian virtues
to his parent. Before that cup was made, which
I stole from our host who owned it, there was
not a more abstemious person in this world; but
with that cup came the love of indulgence and
inebriety. I took away the temptation, and our
host is once more abstemious. Again, I cast
the poor pilgrim into the river. He whom
I drowned was a good Christian; but had he
proceeded further, he would have fallen into
mortal sin: now he is saved and is reigning
in heaven. Neither did I bestow the cup on
the unhospitable citizen without reason: he
gave us his swine’s house; he has received his
reward—the temptation of gluttony and
pleasure. Guard, therefore, thy lips; detract
not from the Almighty; to him all things are
known.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At these words, the hermit fell at the feet of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the angel, and besought his pardon. It was
acceded to him, and he returned to his hermitage
a wiser and a better Christian.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Admitting, of course, the identity of the main incidents,
Parnell must have the credit of heightening those
he has used with many masterly touches of poetic coloring,
and of a happier arrangement of circumstances,”
said Herbert, who had been following the story in the
poet’s works.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Many indeed are the proofs of his genius and address
in the treatment of the subject,” said Lathom. “And no
one more striking, than his delaying the discovery of the
angelic nature of the visitant until the close of the story;
and thus introducing a beautiful description and interesting
surprise.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Read us the part,” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is where the angel has just thrown the guide into
the river—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Wild, sparkling rage inflames the hermit’s eyes,</div>
      <div class='line'>He bursts the bands of fear, and madly cries,</div>
      <div class='line'>Detested wretch—but scarce his speech began,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the strange partner seem’d no longer man.</div>
      <div class='line'>His youthful face grew more serenely sweet;</div>
      <div class='line'>His robe turn’d white, and flow’d upon his feet;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fair rounds of radiant points invest his hair;</div>
      <div class='line'>Celestial odors breathe thro’ purple air;</div>
      <div class='line'>And wings, whose colors glitter’d on the day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wide at his back their gradual plumes display.</div>
      <div class='line'>The form ethereal bursts upon his sight,</div>
      <div class='line'>And moves in all the majesty of light.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Do you suppose that the Gesta was known to the
poet?” asked Frederick Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hardly—he is far more likely to have taken the incidents
of his poem from the Divine Dialogues of the
Platonist Moore; who affixes to his version of the tale
some reflections well worth reading. ‘The affairs of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>world,’ says the old Platonist, ‘are like a curious but intricately
contrived comedy; and we cannot judge of the
tendency of what is past—or acting at present, before
the entrance of the last act, which shall bring in righteousness
in triumph; who though she hath abided many
a brunt, and has been very cruelly and despitefully used
in the world, yet at last, according to our desires, we
shall see the knight overcome the giant.’ ... But
impatiently to call for vengeance upon every enormity
before that time, is rudely to overturn the stage before
the entrance of the fifth act, out of ignorance of the plot
of the comedy; and to prevent the solemnity of the
general judgment, by more paltry and particular executions.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Thanks for the old Platonist’s remarks,” said Herbert.
“I could have wished them more elaborate, were
not Schiller’s Fridolin waiting for the conclusion of
them, to come upon our stage.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I will give you, then, one form of Schiller’s ballad.”</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>FULGENTIUS AND THE WICKED STEWARD.</h3>

<p class='c014'>When Martin was emperor of Rome, his
uncle Malitius was steward of his household,
and his nephew Fulgentius, his only sister’s
son, an orphan, was his constant attendant,
his cup-bearer at meals, and his page of his
chamber. For Martin loved his nephew, and
was kind to him; and regarded him as his own
child, for he was not a father. Malitius hated
this Fulgentius; seeing that if he should succeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>to the kingdom, his own son would lose that
crown which he had so long regarded as his by
right of inheritance. Day and night he thought
how he might cause Martin to discard Fulgentius.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” said he with a face of assumed
distress, one day to the emperor, “it is with
great pain, my lord, that I speak unto you, but
in that I am thy true servant, it is my duty to
warn my sovereign of any thing that lessens his
honor and repute.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Speak on,” said the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will my lord,” rejoined the steward with
apparent anxiety, “keep what I shall tell him
a secret between him and me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If thou wishest it, Malitius,” said the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my dear lord, how ungrateful is the
world,” began the steward.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, well, that is as it may be,” rejoined
the emperor; “but to your secret, the sun is
rising high in the heavens, and my horses wait
me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your nephew, Fulgentius—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha!” said Martin, “Fulgentius; what of
him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I grieve to say, my lord, he most ungratefully
defames you among his companions, speaking
ill of your habits, and especially of your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>breath, and saying that it is death to him to
serve you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I could but prove this,” muttered the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Remark him, my lord, when he next serves
you with the cup, and if he turns away his head
when he gives you the goblet, be sure that he
so accuses, and thus endeavors to make the bystanders
believe that his accusation is true.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is well,” replied the emperor; “go, good
Malitius, we will remember your advice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then went the steward unto Fulgentius, and
spoke kindly to him, and professed, as a friend
and a near relative, to warn him how nearly he
was about to lose the good wishes of Martin, and
perhaps forfeit his succession to the throne.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fulgentius, my dear relative,” said he with
a fawning smile, “thy breath is sadly displeasing
to the emperor, and he talks of removing
you from near attendance on his person.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! good sir,” replied the youth, “can this
be true?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alas! I fear it is so. I have experienced it
myself; but be sure it is merely temporary ill
health, it will soon pass off.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And before then I shall have lost my uncle’s
good opinion. What shall I do, Malitius?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is but one thing,” replied the steward;
“when you hand the cup to the emperor, turn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>away your head from him; then will he not be
incommoded by your breath, and will see that
you do your best to please him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, good Malitius. Your advice has
made me feel happy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thy happiness be thy ruin,” muttered Malitius
to himself as he turned away.</p>

<p class='c007'>That day Fulgentius attended on his uncle at
dinner; and as he handed to him the cup he
held it far off, and turned away his face, lest he
should distress the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wretch!” cried the emperor, at the same
time striking Fulgentius on the breast; “now
know I that it is true what I have heard of thee;
go, go from my sight, thou varlet, I thought to
have made thee a king; but now see my face
no more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sorely wept Fulgentius as he passed from the
hall, amid the jeers and scoffs of his former
companions; for he was now disgraced, and
they cared not for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Malitius,” said the emperor, “let thy son
supply the place of this ingrate. Come, my
good lord, counsel me how I may rid myself of
this varlet, that disgraces me before the world.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sire, this would I propose; some miles from
this city your workmen burn lime in a vast
forge in the forest; send to them this night, and
bid them cast into their furnace whoever first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>comes to them to-morrow morning, and asks of
them ‘Have you performed the emperor’s will?’
Call also Fulgentius to thee, and bid him early
on the morrow go to the lime-burners, and ask
them whether they have fulfilled your commands;
then will they cast him into the fire,
and his evil words will perish with him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the emperor did so. He bade Fulgentius
be at the kilns before sunrise; and that night
sent a horseman to the lime-burners, bidding
them burn the first man that on the morrow
should inquire of them whether they had performed
the emperor’s will.</p>

<p class='c007'>Long before sunrise Fulgentius rose from his
sleepless couch, and hastened to perform his
uncle’s commands, hoping by this means to regain
the good-will of the emperor. As he went
on his way with a heavy heart, and drew near
to the wood within the depths of which the
lime-burners dwelt, the sound of the matin bell
of a neighboring chapel arrested his steps. The
tones of the bell seemed to bring peace to his
troubled mind, and he turned from the path
towards the way-side chapel, and offered up his
prayers and thanksgivings to his God. But as
the service was ending, the fatigue he had undergone
disposed him to rest himself; so he sat
himself down in the porch of the chapel and fell
asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Poor child,” said the good priest as he passed
through the porch, “thou lookest wearied and
careworn; sleep on, no one shall disturb thee.”
When he awoke the sun was going down in the
heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malitius was as sleepless during the night as
the poor youth, and his anxiety drove him early
from his bed, and suffered him not to be at peace
all the day. Now when it was noon the steward
could no longer remain in the palace, but he
hastened to the lime-kilns, and demanded of the
lime-burners “whether they had performed the
emperor’s will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not yet,” cried they, with hoarse voices,
“but no fear, master; it shall be done forthwith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words, the men seized Malitius,
and hurried with him in their arms to the
mouth of the kiln.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mercy, mercy, good sirs,” cried the steward,
“it is Fulgentius you should burn; not me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! ha!” laughed the lime-burners; “we
know neither thee nor Fulgentius; thou art
the first man that has come here this day and
asked us: ‘Whether we have done the emperor’s
will’; so peace, man, peace. Ha! ha! his
will is done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So Malitius died in the fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was past noon when Fulgentius awoke, and
the sun was going down in its course.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“Alas! alas!” he said, “I have delayed to
perform my lord’s will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And he hastened through the wood, and came
to the lime-kilns.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What wantest thou, boy?” asked the chief
of the lime-burners.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me, tell me, sirs,” asked Fulgentius,
anxiously, “hast thou performed the command
of the emperor?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ay, my lad, right well; come, look into the
furnace—and see, his bones yet burn.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“His bones; whose bones, sirs?” asked Fulgentius,
aghast with fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then they told him all that had been commanded
them, and how Malitius coming first to
the lime-kilns had been cast into the fire and
burnt.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks be to God,” said the youth, devoutly
kneeling, “who hath saved me from this terrible
death.” With these words he bade the
burners farewell, and returned to his uncle’s
palace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha!” said the emperor, when Fulgentius
bowed himself before his uncle’s throne, “thou
here, sir varlet; hast thou not been to my lime-burners?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Verily, my lord, I have been there and performed
thy commandment; but before I came
your will had been performed.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Performed,” rejoined the emperor, “how
performed? Malitius; is he not here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, my lord, he is burnt in the lime-kiln,”
replied the youth; “he came first to the kiln,
and the burners obeyed your commands, and he
is dead, and I have escaped. But, O my dear
uncle, how couldst thou contrive such a death
for thy poor nephew?” and he wept bitterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then did they each declare to the other the
deceits of the wicked steward; and the emperor
raised up the youth, and acknowledged him before
all his people as his very true and good
nephew, his heir and successor to the throne;
rendering thanks to God who had preserved the
uncle from so deadly a sin against his relative,
and the nephew from so horrible a death.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The German poet has been equally successful in his
amendments with Parnell,” said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“In none more so,” said Thompson, “than in substituting
in the place of the unpleasant bodily affection, the
more courtly failing of jealousy excited in the mind of
the knight by the malice of the huntsman Robert.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Was it then from this old book, or from some similar
tradition of his own country, that Schiller obtained his
incidents?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is impossible to determine; it is said that Schiller
learnt his plot from an Alsatian legend that he heard at
Manheim; and yet the similarity of the incident renders
it more than probable that the poet was acquainted with
this form of the tale. The story as it appears in the
monks’ books, and the tradition of Alsatia, most probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>started from the same original, which, being immediately
written down by the monk, we now have in its
original form. The tradition went on from mouth to
mouth, and became gradually varied to suit the popular
feelings.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your instances of conversion, Lathom,” said Thompson,
“remind me of Washington Irving’s vision in the
library of the British Museum, when all the old writers
leapt down from their shelves and despoiled the moderns
of the patchwork garments, made of the shreds of countless
writers, and left them plucked of their borrowed
plumes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay,” replied Lathom, “rather of those few who had
borrowed gems from the writers of old, and by new setting
and repolishing so improved their original lustre
that the former owner was eager to tender his thanks
to his modern adapter, who had renewed his long-lost
glories.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am afraid your old monks would have had as many
to pluck of their borrowed plumes as to compliment on
their ingenuity as working jewellers,” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The process of recovery would be curious in some
cases,” said Herbert: “the modern adapter would have
to settle with Lydgate or Gower; the old poet would resign
his title to the middle-age monk or chronicler; and
he perhaps be finally stripped of his gem by some Eastern
fabler.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Be sure that Shakspeare, Parnell, and Schiller would
meet with more thanks than reproaches,” was Lathom’s
reply, as he closed his book for that evening.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“The use Shakespeare has made of your monks’ tales
would seem to augur a certain popularity of the
work in the days in which he wrote,” said Herbert, when
the friends met on their sixth evening.</p>

<p class='c012'>“A greater popularity than will now be credited: in
the reign of Elizabeth and her successor, the Gesta
Romanorum seems to have been sufficiently well known
to admit of a frequent reference to it on the stage,” replied
Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Allusions to the work, not incidents from it?” asked
Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, in the anonymous comedy of Sir Giles’ Goose
Cap, published early in James’ reign, one of the characters
speaks of the ‘quips and quick jests of his lordship
as so good that Gesta Romanorum were nothing to
them’; whilst Chapman in his ‘May-Day,’ which dates
in 1611, says, ‘one that has read Marcus Aurelius, Gesta
Romanorum, and the Mirror of Magistrates, to be led by
the nose like a blind bear that has read nothing!’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The slightest knowledge of the accomplishments of
the Tudor and early Stuart times compels us to admit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the extensive acquaintance with Latin writers possessed
by classes to whom now they seem so little fitted,” remarked
Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“An acquaintance arising in all probability from the
absence of a native literature, as well as from the position
held by the Latin language in that age; the French of
the present generation,” rejoined Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Whose conversions have we to-night?” asked
Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not any: not that my catalogue is run out, but partly
because I have not been able to keep up with the speed
of our reading; and partly because I wished to illustrate
the moralizations attached to the tales, which we have
lately rather lost sight of.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What peculiar doctrine are you intending to illustrate?”
asked Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The 26th article of our Church, that the effect of the
ordinance is not taken away, nor the grace of God’s gifts
diminished by the ministration of evil men; it is the
story of</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“THE WICKED PRIEST.”</h3>

<p class='c014'>In the reign of Otho there was a certain
wicked priest who created much dissatisfaction
among his parishioners; and many were
extremely scandalized. One of them, in particular,
always absented himself from the mass
when it was the turn of this priest to celebrate
it. Now it happened on a festival day, during
the time of mass, that as this person was walking
alone through a meadow, a sudden thirst
came upon him, insomuch that he was persuaded,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>unless present relief could be obtained,
he should die.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this extremity continuing his walk, he discovered
a rivulet of the purest water, of which
he copiously drank; but the more he drank the
more violent became his thirst. Surprised at
so unusual a circumstance, he said to himself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will find out the source of this rivulet, and
there will I satisfy my thirst.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these thoughts he went up the stream.
And as he went a venerable old man met and
asked him whither he was going.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father,” he replied, “I am oppressed with
an unquenchable thirst, and even now I drank
of this rivulet; and lo, the more I drink, so
much the more I thirst; and I now seek its
source, if, perchance, I may there quench my
thirst, and not die.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old man pointed with his finger:
“There,” said he, “is the spring-head of the
rivulet. But tell me, my honest friend, why are
you not at church, and, with other good Christians,
hearing mass?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Truly, master,” answered the man, “our
priest leads such an execrable life that I think
it utterly impossible that he should celebrate it
so as to please God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Suppose what you say is true,” replied the
old man; “observe this fountain, from which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>so much excellent water issues, and from which
you have so lately drunk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked in the direction pointed out, and
beheld a putrid dog, with its mouth wide open,
and its teeth black and decayed, through which
the whole fountain gushed in a surprising manner.
The man regarded the stream with terror
and confusion of mind, ardently desirous of
quenching his thirst, but apprehensive of poison
from the fetid and loathsome carcass, with
which, to all appearance, the water was imbued.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be not afraid,” said the old man, observing
his repugnance, “thou hast already drank of
the rivulet, drink again; it will not harm thee.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Encouraged by these assurances, and impelled
by the intensity of his thirst, he partook of it
once more, and instantly recovered from the
drought.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Master, dear master,” exclaimed the man,
“never man drank of such delicious water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“See now,” the old man answered, “as this
water, gushing through the mouth of a putrid
dog, is neither polluted, nor loses aught of its
natural taste or color, so is the celebration of
the mass by a worthless minister; and, therefore,
though the vices of such men may displease
and disgust, yet should you not forsake
the duties of which they are the appointed organ.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Saying these words, the old man disappeared;
and what the other had seen he communicated
to his neighbors, and ever after punctually attended
mass. He brought this unstable and
transitory life to a good end, and passed from
that which is corruptible to inherit incorruption.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There is but one fiction,” said Herbert, “in this legend
which requires further explanation; why the
stream of the fountain of life is made to flow through
the rank jaws of a putrid dog rather than that of any
other animal.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The incident is intentional,” rejoined Lathom; “an
old couplet ascribes to the dog four special qualities: a
healing tongue, a distinguishing sense of smell, a perfect
love, and unremitting watchfulness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You allude to the lines—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In cane bis bina sunt, et lingua medicina,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Naris odoratus, amor integer, atque latratus,</span>’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” rejoined Lathom, “these four qualities, say the
old writers, ought to be diligently cultivated by a priest.
By his tongue he should heal the sick at heart, and probe
the wounds of sin, careful not to heal with roughness
the soul’s wounds, but to lick them as the dog does those
of the body. His keenness of perception should be able
to distinguish the true confession from the false one; to
see what is due to cunningness, what to internal struggles,
what to reckless contempt of consequences. He,
too, should have as unshaken a love for the Church and
the faith as the dog for its master or its charge; ready to
lay down his life for his flock. As the watch-dog of the
great King, his warning voice must be raised against
enemies from without, preventing, by his diligence in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>his calling, the machinations of the world and its master
against the soul.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The mass is a slight anachronism in the reign of
Otho,” said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You must not mind such trifles. Otho has as little to
do with the wicked priest, as Pompey, whether the great
or an unknown namesake of his, with the incidents of
the story of</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“THE EMPEROR’S DAUGHTER.”</h3>

<p class='c014'>Many centuries ago there reigned a great
and good emperor, whose name was
Pompey. He had an only daughter, of remarkable
beauty, whom he loved so dearly, that day
and night he ordered five of his most valiant
knights to watch over her; and on pain of
their lives to guard her from harm. Day
and night did these brave men keep watch and
ward over the lady’s chamber. A lamp burned
above the door, that the approach of an enemy
might be more readily detected; and a faithful
mastiff lay on the threshold, whose watchfulness
was as unremitting as his bark was loud and
shrill. But all these precautions were fruitless.
The princess loved the world and its pleasures;
and sighed to mingle in its busy scenes, and
gaze upon its gorgeous pageants. One day as
she looked from her window a certain duke rode
by, and he looked upon her beauty, and loved
her with a false love.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Day after day did the duke endeavor to withdraw
the princess from her guardians, and
numerous were the devices by which he sought
to accomplish his designs upon her and her
father’s throne. At length by the promise of
unbounded pleasure, the duke persuaded the
princess to overturn the lamp that burned at
her chamber door, and to poison the dog that
lay at her threshold.</p>

<p class='c007'>That same night, when the lamp was quenched,
and the mastiff silenced, the duke stole upon
the guard and bore away with him the maiden.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the morrow, great was the confusion at
the emperor’s court. Men rode hither and
thither in pursuit of the fugitives, for no one
knew which way they had fled. One knight
alone hit upon their track; a great and terrible
knight he was, the emperor’s champion; and
he came upon them and slew the duke, and
brought the maiden back to her father.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very wroth was the emperor with his daughter,
and he left her to bewail her sins in solitude.
Time and reflection brought repentance,
and the princess bewailed her sins bitterly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now there was a good old man at Pompey’s
court, who was ever ready to intercede with the
emperor on behalf of penitent offenders, and to
whose words Pompey listened willingly. This
lord came to the emperor and told him of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>daughter’s repentance; and his words were
pleasant to the emperor, so that the father was
reconciled to his child, and she was betrothed
by him to a nobleman of worth and power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many and precious were the bridal gifts the
princess received.</p>

<p class='c007'>The good old lord gave her a robe of the
finest and richest wool, on which was worked
this moral: “I have raised thee up, beware
how thou fall again.” He gave her also a ring,
of which the legend was: “What have I done?
How much? Why?”</p>

<p class='c007'>From her father she received a golden coronet,
on which was engraved: “Thy dignity is
from me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From the king’s champion, who rescued her
from her seducer, she received a ring, and the
legend was: “I have loved thee, do thou return
my love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king’s son gave her a ring, and on it was
written: “Thou art noble, despise not thy nobility.”
Whilst on that which her brother presented
to her was engraved: “Approach, fear
not, I am thy brother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The last gift was from her husband, a golden
signet that confirmed her inheritance, and
which bore this motto: “Now thou art
espoused, be faithful.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The princess received these gifts with gratitude,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>and parted not with them but with her
life.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The meanings of some of these presents are clearly
too recondite to be guessed at,” remarked Herbert on
the conclusion of the tale.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You will say so, when we read them. But first of the
actors in the tale,” rejoined Lathom, “the emperor is
<i>our Heavenly Father</i>, and his daughter, the <i>human soul</i>
which he delivers to the <i>five senses</i>, armed by the powers
of baptism, to guard from injury. The burning lamp is
the <i>will</i>, shining brilliantly in good works and dispelling
the gloom of sin. The watchful dog is <i>conscience</i>; as
often as the soul breaks any of the commands of God, it
may be said to look abroad on the world and its dangers.
Then comes the devil, the great seducer, whose triumph
over the soul is easy, when the lamp of the will is extinguished,
and the barking of conscience is silenced.
Then God arises as our champion, and fights for us
against the world, the flesh, and the devil, and leads
back the sinning soul to the palace of the heavenly king.
The sage Lord, the Mediator, is our Saviour: ‘for he is
our peace, who hath made both one.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“This is tolerably clear and probable,” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The marriage presents will compensate for it. From
him, continues the moral, we received the aforesaid
gifts: first a cloak descending to the ankle, that is, his
most precious skin; and said to be of delicate texture,
because it was woven with stripes, blood, bruises, and
other various instances of malice; of which texture
nothing more is meant than this: ‘I have raised thee up,
because I have redeemed thee; do not throw thyself into
further evil.’ That same Christ, our king, gave to us a
glorious crown, that is, when he submitted to be crowned
for our sakes. And of a truth, ‘thy dignity is from me,’
even from that crown. Christ is our champion, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>gave us a sign—that is, the hole in his right hand; and
we ourselves can see how faithfully it is written: ‘I have
loved thee, do thou also love.’ He gave us another ring,
which is the puncture in his left hand, where we see
written: ‘What have I done? How much? Why?’
‘What have I done?’ I have despoiled myself, receiving
the form of a servant. ‘How much?’ I have made God
and man. ‘Why?’ To redeem the lost. Concerning
these three, Zechariah xiii., ‘What are the wounds in the
middle of thy hands?’ and he answered, saying: ‘I am
wounded by these men in their house, who loved me.’
Christ is our brother, and son of the Eternal King. He
gave us a third ring,—to wit, the hole in his right foot;
and what can be understood by it, but, ‘Thou art noble,
despise not thy nobility?’ In like manner, Christ is our
brother-german. And he gave us a fourth ring, the
puncture in his left foot, on which is written, ‘Approach,
fear not, I am thy brother.’ Christ is also our spouse;
he gave us a signet, with which he confirmed our
inheritance: that is, the wound made in his side by the
spear, on account of the great love with which he loved
us. And what can this signify, but, ‘Thou art joined to
me through mercy. Sin no more.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have established the character of the Gesta for
recondite moralization,” said Thompson, “will you give
us a tale rather more intelligible?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Willingly,” rejoined Lathom, “you shall have the
tale that Gower has versified.”</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>THE EMPEROR LEO AND THE THREE IMAGES.</h3>

<p class='c014'>A certain Roman emperor, Leo, was so
fond of looking upon a pretty face, that
he made three fair female images, and placed
them in a temple, that all his subjects might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>look on them and worship. One statue stood
with its hand extended towards the worshippers,
and bore on its finger a golden ring, on which
was the legend, “My finger is generous.” The
second figure had a beard of beaten gold, and on
its brow was written: “I have a beard; if any
one be beardless, let him come to me, and I
will give him one.” The third figure had a
cloak of gold and a purple tunic, and on its
breast was written, “I fear no one.” With so
many temptations came a law, that whosoever
stole either the ring, the beard, or the cloak,
should surely die. A thief was soon found.
According to the poet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There was a clerk, one Lucius,</div>
      <div class='line'>A comely, famous man;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of every wit some what he can,</div>
      <div class='line'>Out-take that him lacketh rule,</div>
      <div class='line'>His own estate to guide and rule—”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>So he took to riotous living, “and was not wise
in his doing”; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</span></i>—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“After the need of his desert,</div>
      <div class='line'>So fell this clerke in poverte.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The thief, whether poor man or ruined clerk,
removed the treasures, was seen by the people,
and brought before the emperor, on the charge
of breaking the royal edict.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>But the thief said: “Good my lord—suffer
me to speak.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the emperor said, “Speak on.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then said the man: “Lo, as I entered the
temple of the three images, the first image
extended to me its finger, as though it would
say, ‘Take this ring’; but yet I doubted of its
wishes, until I read the superscription, ‘My
finger is generous’; then knew I that it was the
pleasure of the statue to give the ring, and
I obeyed and took it. Then came I to the
image with the beard of gold. Methinks the
maker of this had no beard; shall the creature
be better than the creator? that were a plain
and manifest wrong. But still I was modest,
and hesitated, until the words of the inscription,
‘Let him that is beardless come to me, and I will
give him one,’ forbade me to refuse to supply my
own wants by the statue’s gift. As for the
golden cloak, it was in pure charity that I took
it away. Stone is cold, and metal is cold; the
image is of the former, the cloak of the latter.
In winter it was adding cold to cold, in summer
it was too heavy and warm for the season. Still
should I have forborne to rob the statue of its
cloak, had I not seen the words, ‘I fear no one.’
Such intolerable arrogance, in a woman too, was
to be punished. I took the cloak to humble the
statue’s pride.” But all these excuses were useless.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>“Fair sir,” replied Leo, “do you not know
the law, that he who robs the statues shall die?—let
the law be obeyed”; and it was as the
emperor said.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your tale reminds me strongly of the witticisms by
which the elder Dionysius justified his theft of the golden
cloak of Jupiter and the beard of Æsculapius,” said
Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What, when he exchanged the cold gold garment for
the warm woollen robe, and took off the beard of the son
of the beardless?” remarked Thompson; “but let us
hear the moral.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The moral of this tale,” said Lathom, “is the least
strained, and perhaps the best of all the applications
attached to the legends. The emperor is God. The three
images the three sorts of mankind in whom God takes
delight. The first image, with its extended hand and
proffered gift, is no bad symbol of the poor and simple of
this world, who prevail little among the great and powerful
unless their gift is ready in the extended hand.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Why fleecest thou the poor?” asks conscience. “May
I not receive the proffered gift when freely offered?”
replies the wicked man. “Did I not take it, men would
laugh at me—to curb their tongues I take.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A bitter and too often true lesson in all times and all
nations,” remarked Herbert. “We seldom want for a
good excuse.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The second image,” continued Lathom, “is the symbol
of those who are raised to wealth by God’s especial
blessing, and from whom the wicked seek to take away
their property by every pretext. ‘We are bald,’ cry they;
‘we are poor; let us divide this man’s riches among
us.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There were chartists in those days as well as now;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>levelling comes natural to some minds,” said Thompson.
“But to the third figure.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The image with the golden cloak,” continued Lathom,
“represents the good man in power and authority, who
fears not the evil man, encourages virtue, and eradicates
vice. ‘He is proud; he is a tyrant,’ cry the people; ‘we
will not have this man to reign over us.’ But, says the
old monk, ‘The end of these men is according to the
law of the Lord, for they perish miserably.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The old priest’s moral has so well satisfied me, that I
am sorry that our evening is come to a close,” said
Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well—it must be so; but come,” replied Lathom,
“you shall have an enigma to discover. An emperor
found a sarcophagus on which were three circles with
these words: ‘<i>I have expended—I have given—I have kept—I
have possessed—I do possess—I have lost—I am punished.</i>’
Whilst on the front of the chest was written: ‘<i>What I
have expended I have; what I gave away I have.</i>’ Read
me this inscription.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Read it, read it,” remarked Thompson, with a smile;
“‘it is very easy to say, Read it, read it,’ as Liston used to
say; ‘but do it, do it’—that is a different matter. Well!
it is a good night-cap at the worst.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“We confess ourselves conquered,” said Herbert,
when the next evening was come; “your old
monk’s learning is too recondite for us.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“First, then, comes ‘I have expended’: what?—my
life—in judgment, in advice, in authority. ‘I have given’—equipments
to my servants and warriors, charity to the
needy. ‘I have kept’—exact justice. ‘I have possessed’—a
generous and true heart. ‘I do possess’—a hand to
bestow, to protect, to punish. ‘I have lost’—my folly,
the friendship of my foes, the desires of the flesh. ‘I am
punished’—for my sins.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So far, so good; but the most abstruse remains unexplained,”
said Thompson; “on the front of the sarcophagus
was written: ‘What I have expended, I have; what
I gave away, I have.’ How do you read these sayings?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am afraid I cannot help you,” rejoined Lathom;
“the story seems to be defective at this point, and we
must fall back on the suggestions of the translator, of
whom I have spoken before. Mr. Swan refers the
words ‘What I have expended, I have’ to a judicious outlay
of property, by which various benefits are reaped by
the expender in the persons of his descendants; whilst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>the other words, ‘What I have given away, I have,’ he
explains of the thanks of the poor and the blessings of
heaven consequent on charitable gifts.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your story reminds me of the old epitaph in Doncaster
Church,” said Herbert, “which Gough gives in
these words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>“‘Howe, howe, who is heare?</div>
      <div class='line'>I, Robert of Doncaster, and Margaret my feare (wife),</div>
      <div class='line in14'><i>That I spent, that I had</i>;</div>
      <div class='line in14'><i>That I gave, that I have</i>;</div>
      <div class='line in14'><i>That I left, that I lost</i>:</div>
      <div class='line in24'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1579.</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Quoth Robertus Byrkes,</div>

      <div class='line in14'>And yet lived not one?’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“The three centre lines of his epitaph, indeed, bear a
curious likeness to some of the inscriptions on the sarcophagus;
perhaps the wise man who composed the epitaph
may have seen your old monk’s book, or heard its
moralities in many an old pulpit exhortation in his early
days,” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Coincidences are oftentimes just as remarkable as
plagiarisms,” said Herbert. “But come, Sir Tale-teller,
What entertainment have you for us this evening?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A little poetry, not of my own, but so closely resembling
the old tale of the Gesta, that I prefer this poetic
version, of The Lay of the Little Bird, to my own stiff
prose.”</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In days of yore, at least a century since,</div>
      <div class='line'>There liv’d a carle as wealthy as a prince:</div>
      <div class='line'>His name I wot not, but his wide domain</div>
      <div class='line'>Was rich with stream and forest, mead and plain;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>To crown the whole, one manor he possess’d</div>
      <div class='line'>In choice delight so passing all the rest,</div>
      <div class='line'>No castle, burgh, or city might compare</div>
      <div class='line'>With the quaint beauties of that mansion rare.</div>
      <div class='line'>The sooth to say, I fear my words may seem</div>
      <div class='line'>Like some strange fabling, or fantastic dream,</div>
      <div class='line'>If, unadvis’d, the portraiture I trace,</div>
      <div class='line'>And each brave pleasure of that peerless place.</div>
      <div class='line'>Foreknow ye, then, by necromantic might</div>
      <div class='line'>Was rais’d this paradise of all delight:</div>
      <div class='line'>A good knight own’d it first; he, bow’d with age,</div>
      <div class='line'>Died, and his son possess’d the heritage:</div>
      <div class='line'>But the lewd stripling, all to riot bent</div>
      <div class='line'>(His chattles quickly wasted and forespent),</div>
      <div class='line'>Was driven to see this patrimony sold</div>
      <div class='line'>To the base carle of whom I lately told.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ye wot right well there only need be sought</div>
      <div class='line'>One spendthrift heir, to bring great wealth to nought.</div>
      <div class='line'>A lofty tower and strong, the building stood</div>
      <div class='line'>’Midst a vast plain surrounded by a flood;</div>
      <div class='line'>And hence one pebble-paved channel stray’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>That compass’d in a clustering orchard’s shade;</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas a choice, charming plat; abundant round;</div>
      <div class='line'>Flowers, roses, odorous spices cloth’d the ground;</div>
      <div class='line'>Unnumber’d kinds, and all profusely shower’d</div>
      <div class='line'>Such aromatic balsam as they flower’d,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Their fragrance might have stay’d man’s parting breath,</div>
      <div class='line'>And chased the hovering agony of death.</div>
      <div class='line'>The sward one level held, and close above,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tall shapely trees their leafy mantles wove,</div>
      <div class='line'>All equal growth, and low their branches came,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thick set with goodliest fruits of every name.</div>
      <div class='line'>In midst, to cheer the ravish’d gazer’s view,</div>
      <div class='line'>A gushing fount its waters upward threw,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thence slowly on with crystal current pass’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And crept into the distant flood at last:</div>
      <div class='line'>But nigh its source a pine’s umbrageous head</div>
      <div class='line'>Stretch’d far and wide in deathless verdure spread,</div>
      <div class='line'>Met with broad shade the summer’s sultry gleam,</div>
      <div class='line'>And through the livelong year shut out the beam.</div>
      <div class='line'>Such was the scene: yet still the place was bless’d</div>
      <div class='line'>With one rare pleasure passing all the rest:</div>
      <div class='line'>A wondrous bird of energies divine</div>
      <div class='line'>Had fix’d his dwelling in the tufted pine;</div>
      <div class='line'>There still he sat, and there with amorous lay</div>
      <div class='line'>Waked the dim morn, and closed the parting day:</div>
      <div class='line'>Match’d with these strains of linked sweetness wrought,</div>
      <div class='line'>The violin and full-toned harp were nought;</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Of power they were with new-born joy to move</div>
      <div class='line'>The cheerless heart of long-desponding love;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of power so strange, that should they cease to sound,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the blithe songster flee the mystic ground,</div>
      <div class='line'>That goodly orchard’s scene, the pine-tree’s shade,</div>
      <div class='line'>Trees, flowers, and fount, would all like vapor fade.</div>
      <div class='line in4'>‘Listen, listen to my lay!’</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Thus the merry notes did chime,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>‘All who mighty love obey,</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Sadly wasting in your prime,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Clerk and laic, grave and gay!</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Yet do ye, before the rest,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Gentle maidens, mark me tell!</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Store my lesson in your breast,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Trust me it shall profit well:</div>
      <div class='line in8'>Hear, and heed me, and be bless’d!’</div>
      <div class='line'>So sang the bird of old; but when he spied</div>
      <div class='line'>The carle draw near, with alter’d tone he cried—</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Back, river, to thy source! and thee, tall tower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thee, castle strong, may gaping earth devour!</div>
      <div class='line'>Bend down your heads, ye gaudy flowers, and fade!</div>
      <div class='line'>And wither’d be each fruit-tree’s mantling shade!</div>
      <div class='line'>Beneath these beauteous branches once were seen,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Brave gentle knights disporting on the green,</div>
      <div class='line'>And lovely dames; and oft, these flowers among,</div>
      <div class='line'>Stray’d the blithe bands, and joyed to hear my song:</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor would they hence retire, nor quit the grove,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till many a vow were pass’d of mutual love;</div>
      <div class='line'>These more would cherish, those would more deserve;</div>
      <div class='line'>Cost, courtesy, and arms, and nothing swerve.</div>
      <div class='line'>O bitter change! for master now we see</div>
      <div class='line'>A faitour villain carle of low degree;</div>
      <div class='line'>Foul gluttony employs his livelong day,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor heeds, nor hears he my melodious lay.’</div>
      <div class='line'>So spake the bird; and, as he ceas’d to sing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Indignantly he clapp’d his downy wing,</div>
      <div class='line'>And straight was gone; but no abasement stirr’d</div>
      <div class='line'>In the clown’s breast at his reproachful word:</div>
      <div class='line'>Bent was his wit alone by quaint device</div>
      <div class='line'>To snare, and sell him for a passing price.</div>
      <div class='line'>So well he wrought, so craftily he spread</div>
      <div class='line'>In the thick foliage green his slender thread,</div>
      <div class='line'>That when at eve the little songster sought</div>
      <div class='line'>His wonted spray, his little foot was caught.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘How have I harm’d you?’ straight he ’gan to cry,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘And wherefore would you doom me thus to die?’</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>‘Nay, fear not,’ quoth the clown, ‘for death or wrong;</div>
      <div class='line'>I only seek to profit by thy song:</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll get thee a fine cage, nor shalt thou lack</div>
      <div class='line'>Good store of kernels and of seeds to crack;</div>
      <div class='line'>But sing thou shalt; for if thou play’st the mute,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll spit thee, bird, and pick thy bones to boot.’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Ah, woe is me!’ the little thrall replied.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Who thinks of song, in prison doomed to bide?</div>
      <div class='line'>And, were I cook’d, my bulk might scarce afford</div>
      <div class='line'>One scanty mouthful to my hungry lord.’</div>
      <div class='line'>What may I more relate?—the captive wight</div>
      <div class='line'>Assay’d to melt the villain all he might;</div>
      <div class='line'>And fairly promis’d, were he once set free,</div>
      <div class='line'>In gratitude to teach him secrets three;</div>
      <div class='line'>Three secrets, all so marvellous and rare,</div>
      <div class='line'>His race knew nought that might with these compare.</div>
      <div class='line'>The carle prick’d up his ears amain; he loos’d</div>
      <div class='line'>The songster thrall, by love of gain seduc’d;</div>
      <div class='line'>Up to the summit of the pine-tree’s shade</div>
      <div class='line'>Sped the blithe bird, and there at ease he stay’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And trick’d his plumes full leisurely, I trow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till the carle claim’d his promise from below:</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Right gladly,’ quoth the bird; ‘now grow thee wise:</div>
      <div class='line'>All human prudence few brief lines comprise:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>First then, lest haply in the event it fail,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Yield not a ready faith to every tale</span>.’</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Is this thy secret?’ quoth the moody elf.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Keep then thy silly lesson for thyself;</div>
      <div class='line'>I need it not.’—‘How be ’tis not amiss</div>
      <div class='line'>To prick thy memory with advice like this,</div>
      <div class='line'>But late, meseems, thou hadst forgot the lore;</div>
      <div class='line'>Mark next my second rule, and sadly know,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>What’s lost, ’tis wise with patience to forego</span>.’</div>
      <div class='line'>The carle, though rude of wit, now chafed amain;</div>
      <div class='line'>He felt the mockery of the songster’s strain.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Peace,’ quoth the bird; ‘my third is far the best;</div>
      <div class='line'>Store thou the precious treasure in thy breast:</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>What good thou hast, ne’er lightly from thee cast</span>.’</div>
      <div class='line'>—He spoke, and twittering fled away full fast.</div>
      <div class='line'>Straight sunk in earth, the gushing fountain dries,</div>
      <div class='line'>Down fall the fruits, the wither’d pine-tree dies,</div>
      <div class='line'>Fades all the beauteous plat, so cool, so green,</div>
      <div class='line'>Into thin air, and never more is seen.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Such was the meed of avarice:—bitter cost!</div>
      <div class='line'>The carle who all would gather, all has lost.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“There is something very Eastern about this tale,” remarked
Herbert at its conclusion.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is found in the old Greek monk’s legend of Barlaam
and Josaphat,” replied Lathom, “to whom it is more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>probable that it came from the East than from any other
source.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Such a story, I should suppose, has been freely used
by later writers,” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It appears in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Disciplina Clericalis</span> of Alphonsus,
in The Golden Legend of Caxton, and in Lydgate under
the title of ‘The Chorle and the Bird’; but besides these
and Mr. Way, whose version I have just read you, I cannot
discover any other writers who have made use of this
fiction.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The moral of this fiction explains itself,” said Herbert.
“I presume the author is content with the plain meaning.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, for this once,” rejoined Lathom; “but be content,
the next story will satisfy the greatest lover of allegories;
for curious, indeed, is it as an instance, even
among curiosities, of the once common practice of converting
every thing into allegory.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How is it entitled?” asked Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘Of the Burdens of this Life’; in form it is a dialogue
between a scholar and his master, who might well be
supposed to change places with each other. You must
be content with Mr. Swan’s version.”</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>OF THE BURDENS OF THIS LIFE.</h3>

<p class='c014'>A certain king once went to a fair, and
took with him a preceptor and his scholar.
Standing in the market-place they perceived
eight packages for sale. The scholar questioned
his teacher respecting the first of them. “Pray,”
said he, “what is the price of poverty? that is,
of tribulation for the love of God?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span><i>Preceptor.</i> The kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> It is a great price indeed. Open the
second package and let us see what it contains.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> It contains meekness: Blessed are
the meek.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> Meekness indeed is a very illustrious
thing, and worthy of divine majesty. What is
its price?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> Neither gold nor silver will be
taken; they are too contemptible. I demand
earth for it; and nothing but earth will I
receive.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> There is a spacious tract of uninhabited
country between India and Great Britain.
Take as much of it as you please.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> No; this land is the land of the
dying; the land which devours its inhabitants.
Men die there. I demand the land of the living.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> I muse at what you say. All die,
and would you alone be exempt? Would you
live for ever? Behold, blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth. What is there
in the third package?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> Hunger and thirst.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> For how much may these be purchased?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> For righteousness. Blessed are
they who hunger and thirst after righteousness,
for they shall be filled.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span><i>Scholar.</i> Therefore you shall possess righteousness,
provided there be no neglect. What
does the fourth contain?</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Preceptor.</i> Tears, wailings, and woe;</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Moisture above, and moisture below.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> It is not customary to buy tears and
wailings, yet I will buy it; because the saints
desire it at this price. Blessed are they who
mourn, for they shall be comforted. What is
the fifth package?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> It is a divided parcel, and contains
<i>mercy</i>, which I will weigh to please you. At a
word, I will take mercy for mercy; eternity for
time.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> You were a bad umpire to ask this,
unless mercy should plead for you. Nevertheless,
she shall become your surety. And blessed
are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
In this life we abound in poverty and wretchedness
and hardship. Undo the sixth package,
perhaps it may contain something better.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> It is clearly full, but it loves not,
like a purple robe, to be exposed before the
common eye; you shall see it in private, and
then we will agree about the price.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> Very well; what is next?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> Purity; which is extremely valuable.
That gold and silver vase contains piety,
goodness, charity, and spiritual joy. Now then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>let us open these precious garments. Here are
lectures, meditations, prayers, and contemplations.
The judgments of the Lord are justified
in themselves, and more to be desired than gold
and precious stones.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> There is a great reward in the possession.
Ask, therefore, what you will.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> To see God.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> Therefore, Blessed are the pure in
heart, for they shall see God. Open the seventh
package.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> It contains <i>peace</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> What! are you going to <i>sell</i> me your
peace?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> It does not accord with my poverty,
nor would it with your justice and great wealth,
to take any thing of me for nothing. But your
liberality will make me rich. What then? I am
a mean country fellow, and made of clay; formed
of the very dust of the earth. My want of nobility
oppresses me, and I would no longer bear
the reproach which says: “You are earth, and
to earth you shall go.” I would rather have it
said to me: “You are heaven, and to heaven
you shall go.” I eagerly desire to fulfil the destiny
of the sons of God; I would become a son
of God.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> I have done; I confess the truth, and
distrust you no longer. Blessed are the peacemakers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>for they shall be called the sons of God.
If, therefore, you preserve the love of a son, you
shall receive the paternal inheritance. Now
what is contained in the last package? Explain
it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> It contains only tribulation and
persecution for the sake of righteousness.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> What do you want for it?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> The kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> I gave you that as the price of
poverty!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preceptor.</i> True; but month after month, week
after week, man wanders in his wishes. Before
the present week or month expires, what will
remain of it?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Scholar.</i> I marvel at your sagacity in making
a bargain. Now hear, good and faithful servant!
because thou hast been faithful over a few things,
I will appoint thee lord over many.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The allusion to the king’s visit to the fair,” said Herbert,
“reminds me of what Wharton says of the royal
booth at the fair of St. Botolph, at Boston, in Lincolnshire,
from which stall or booth the king drew
revenue.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Before roads were general and passable, and the
communication between town and town was frequent,
the concourse of people at the various fairs must have
been very great,” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As great as even now in many parts of the East,
where the fairs are still regarded as the great emporia of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>merchandise, the universal mart of extensive districts,
dependent on such meetings for their chief supplies.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wharton,” said Herbert, “gives a curious account of
St. Giles’ fair at Winchester, which dated back to the
Conquest, was held for three days, and, by later grants,
extended to sixteen; and was given by William the Conqueror
to the bishops of Winchester as a source of
revenue.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Doubtless no mean revenue was derived from it,”
said Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“For those days, very great: the jurisdiction of the
fair extended for seven miles round, including the port
of Southampton; and every merchant who sold wares
within that circuit, except at the fair, or refused to pay
the bishop’s toll, had his goods forfeited to the bishop.
In the middle of St. Giles’ Down stood the bishop’s
pavilion, where sat his court, supreme, so long as the
fair lasted, within the seven miles’ jurisdiction.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What, over other existing jurisdictions, the lords of
the neighborhood, or the corporation of Winchester?”
asked Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes, supreme for the time. Even the city was for the
time under the bishop’s rule; on St. Giles’ eve the keys
were delivered to him, and during the fair toll was
exacted in his name on all goods that went through the
city gate. No baron within the circuit could hold his
manor-court without a license from the bishop’s pavilion.
The bishop appointed a mayor, bailiff, and coroner
of his own during the fair.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Being so near the coast, foreigners must have often
resorted to the great Winchester fair, I presume?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” rejoined Herbert. “So numerous and powerful
that they had their separate street in the fair, as the
drapers, and spice-dealers, and potters had theirs; and
the toll to the bishop from the foreign merchants formed
no mean portion of the revenue he derived from the fair.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“It was an old custom for merchants to meet from all
countries at the different fairs,” said Lathom. “I remember
to have read that in 1314, Philip of France
remonstrated with our second Edward on the great loss
his subjects had received from the merchants of England
desisting from frequenting the fairs in France.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” remarked Frederick Thompson; “in the days
of the Edwards and Henrys a fair was as great a panacea
for evils, as public meetings in this century. If a village
was sacked or destroyed by fire or flood, the grant of
a fair was an established means of restoring it to its
pristine vigor.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must look abroad for the old fairs, such as they
were in the middle ages,” said Herbert. “Frankfort
and Leipzig still remind us of such fairs as that at Winchester;
thirty to forty thousand buyers and sellers are
not uncommonly seen at Leipzig, the last great fair
of Central Europe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And yet,” said Lathom, “both of these are but children
to the great fair of Nischnei-Novgorod, where merchants
from the banks of the Baltic and the Caspian
interchange goods with Khivans, Chinese, the mountaineers
of Central Asia, and the merchants of Western
Europe.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is, indeed, almost difficult to believe Kohl’s account
of the meeting at Nischnei-Novgorod,” said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wonderful, but of admitted truth. How curious
must be the scenes: a town of vast emporia, mingled
with nearly three thousand shops, almost without an
inhabitant, save a few government officials, until the
flag is raised on the 29th of June; then the town is alive
like an ant-hill. Every magazine and booth is filled
with merchandise, the produce of the most diverse
countries; thousands of boats are landing goods, or
taking them to other vessels; piles of merchandise stand
on all sides, even in the open country; and amidst all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>this treasury of wealth, three hundred thousand of
nearly all nations under heaven are trafficking.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The value of goods exposed at such fairs must
be startling, if capable of being calculated,” said
Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The system of fair-tolls makes this an easy matter.
In 1839, the value of goods exposed at twenty-two of the
fairs of Russia, reached fifteen millions and a half, of
which Novgorod contributed nearly one half.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Roubles,” suggested Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, sterling pounds.” With this digressive conversation,
the evening closed.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>“Are you going to give us a specimen of the late

<p class='c007'>“Even so—to claim for the magic garden of Aloaddin,
the gem of the sixth book of Thalaba, at least a Latin
form, if it must not be regarded as a striking instance of
my Eastern theory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Southey did not come to your book for this idea; he
was content with the apparently historical account of
Purchas in his Pilgrims, or the more elaborate description
of the notorious Mandeville,” rejoined Thompson.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am very much at a loss to appreciate your account,”
said Herbert,  “as Southey, Purchas, and Mandeville are
nearly all equally unknown to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The best means of showing the progress of the story
and its conversion by the poet,” said Lathom, “will be
to commence with the old monk’s very short version;
let that be followed by Mandeville, and that veritable
author by Southey’s description. The monk’s tale is,</p>

  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE EVIL ONE.”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There was a celebrated magician who had
a vast castle surrounded by a very beautiful
garden, in which grew flowers of the most
fragrant smell, and fruits not only fair to look
upon but most delicious to the taste. In short,
it was a garden of Paradise; no one was allowed
to see its glories, or taste its pleasures, but fools
or personal enemies of the magician. When the
gate was opened to any one, great was his wonder
and delight; and few who entered ever
wished to return. Nay, the pleasures they
there enjoyed so affected their minds, that
they yielded forthwith to the will of the magician,
and were ready to resign to him every
thing that they had.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the fools this garden appeared to be Paradise
itself: its flowers and its fruits they looked
upon as of immortal growth, and regarded themselves
as chosen from among the inhabitants of
the world as the happy possessors of the land.
Beyond this they gave not one thought. Day
and night they revelled in pleasure, and surrendered
their minds and their bodies to lawless
gratifications.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last the day of reckoning came, and the
magician prepared to reap the fruits of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>scheme. Their inheritances once placed in his
power, he waited but for some moment when
his victim was steeped in sensual intoxication,
and then fell upon him and slew him. Thus,
by his fictitious Paradise, he acquired great
wealth and power.</p>

<p class='c015'>“I admire the moderation of your old monk,” said
Thompson, “in not assigning a particular locality to his
magician’s paradise. Purchas and Mandeville are not
so moderate; the former puts Aloaddin’s abode in the
northeast parts of Persia, and Mandeville locates him
in the island of Milsterak, a portion of the kingdom of
Prester John.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No bad illustration,” said Herbert, “of the difference
between a writer who tells a fiction as a fiction, and one
who records it with the intention of making his readers
believe it to be true.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Great particularity as to time, place, and persons is
the sure mark of a mendacious traveller,” remarked Lathom;
“both Purchas and Mandeville have altered the
object of the magician’s plot; making it his means of
destroying his enemies, by persuading his victims that
death in his service was only a step to a more beautiful
paradise. I will read Mandeville’s tale of</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“COTONOLAPES, THE MAGICIAN.”</h3>

<p class='c014'>In the isle of Pentexoire, that is in the land of
Prester John, is a great isle, long and broad,
and men call that isle Milsterak. There was a
man there that was called Cotonolapes; he was
full rich, and had a fair castle on a hill, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>strong, and he made a wall all about the hill
right strong and fair; within he had a fair garden,
wherein were many trees bearing all manner
of fruits that he might find, and he had
planted therein all manner of herbs of good
smell, and that bare flowers, and there were
many fair wells, and by them were made many
halls and chambers well dight with gold and
azure, and he had made there divers stories of
beasts and birds, that sung and turned by engine
and orbage as they had been quick; and
he had in his garden all things that might be to
man solace and comfort; he had also in that
garden maidens within the age of fifteen years,
the fairest that he might find, and men children
of the same age, and they were clothed with
cloth of gold, and he said that they were
angels; and he caused to be made certain
hills, and inclosed them about with precious
stones of jasper and crystal, and set in gold
and pearls, and other manner of stones; and
he had made a conduit under the earth, so that
when he would, the walls ran sometimes with
milk, sometimes with wine, sometimes with
honey, and this place is called Paradise; and
when any young bachelor of the country, knight
or esquire, cometh to him for solace and disport,
he leadeth them into his paradise and
showeth them these things, as the songs of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>birds, and his damsels and wells; and he did
strike divers instruments of music in a high
tower that might be heard, and said they were
angels of God, and that place was Paradise that
God had granted to those who believe, when
he said thus: <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dabo vobis terram fluentem lacte
et melle</span></i>; that is to say, I shall give you land
flowing with milk and honey. And then this
rich man made these men drink a manner of
drink of which they were drunken; and he said
to them, if they would die for his sake, when
they were dead they should come to his paradise,
and they should be of the age of those
maidens, and should dwell always with them,
and he should put them in a fairer paradise,
where they should see God in joy and in his
majesty: and then they granted to do that
he would, and he bade them go and slay such a
lord, or a man of the country that he was wroth
with, and that they should have dread of no
man. And if they were slain themselves for his
sake, he should put them in his paradise when
they were dead. And so went these bachelors
to slay great lords of the country, and were slain
themselves in hope to have that paradise; and
thus he was avenged of his enemies through his
desert; and when rich men of the country perceived
this cautel and malice, and the will of
this Cotonolapes, they gathered them together
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>and assailed the castle, and slew him, and destroyed
all his goods and his fair places and
riches that were in his paradise; and the place
of the walls there is yet, and some other things,
but the riches are not, and it is not long ago
since it was destroyed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The variation made by this worthy story-teller seems
to me to be an incorporation of the history of the Assassins,”
said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps their ‘Old Man of the Mountain,’ as the
chief of the Assassins was called, may have given rise
to the entire fable,” rejoined Lathom. “Now, Thompson,
read the poet’s conversion.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>“I think I must stop here,” said Thompson, “though
the entire book seems but the poet’s amplification of the
tale of Mandeville.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The more I think on the subject, the more certain I
feel that the Assassins of the eleventh century are the
origin, if not of your tradition, at least of the tales of
Purchas and Mandeville,” said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I know too little of their history, to agree with you or
not; surely, theirs was a purely political association,”
answered Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Their original and avowed object was the placing a
caliph of the race of Ismael on the throne of Bagdad;
but their sacred doctrines are supposed to have embraced
a wider sphere, and are known to have been converted
into the means of private revenge by the adept, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>afterwards became known as the ‘old man of the
mountain.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Where did the old man reign?” asked Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“On the mountain of Alamoot, in the north of Persia.
The Vulture’s Rest, as its name imported, was not unlike
the hill of Cotonolapes, or the Castle of the Magician of
the Gesta. There Hassan ben Sabah gathered round
him an independent society of seven degrees, with himself
as their head, by the title of Sheikh of the Mountain.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What was the date of that event?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Within a few years of the close of the eleventh century,”
replied Herbert. “His seven degrees commenced
with the three grand priors, under him, the practical
rulers of the society. Then came the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dais</span></i>, or initiated
ministers; and fourthly, the <i>refeeks</i>, or companions. Below
these were the <i>fedavees</i>, or devoted, who were followed
by the <i>laseeks</i>, the aspirants, the novices of European
orders. The profane, the common people, formed
the last of the seven orders of the Assassins.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The mysteries, I suppose, were not revealed to any
below the third class?” remarked Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No, the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dais</span></i> were alone acquainted with these; what
they were, besides implicit obedience to their chief, and
the principle of interpreting the Koran allegorically, it
is impossible to discover. By the rest of the society, the
text of the Koran was to be observed in its strict letter.
The <i>fedavees</i> were, however, the support of the society.
They were composed, too often, of youths stolen from
their parents, and educated in such a system as recognized
the sheikh as omnipotent, and impressed on them
the moral and religious duty of obeying his commands.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“From this order, then, the common idea of the Assassins
arose?” said Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Undoubtedly,” rejoined Herbert. “They were led to
look to his mandates as direct from heaven, and as impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>to be evaded. They were clothed in white, with
red bonnets and girdles, and armed with sharp daggers;
but when a secret and dangerous mission was imposed,
the disguises of the <i>fedavees</i> were appropriated to the
task enjoined.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Is any thing known of their initiatory ceremonies?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But little; Marco Polo, indeed, gives us a curious account
of the garden of Alamoot bearing a very strong
likeness to that of Aloaddin, whither the <i>fedavee</i> was
borne under the influence of opiates, before being
sent on any important mission; and where, on awakening,
he found himself surrounded with every earthly
pleasure. This, he was persuaded, is but a foretaste of
the joys of paradise, which were to be the reward of his
faithful performance of the mission. And thus buoyed
up, the <i>fedavees</i> confronted danger in every form, and
executed the commands of their chief in despite of
countless difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Their name, I suppose, is but the corruption of that
of their leader, Hassan,” remarked Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Here doctors disagree,” replied Herbert; “some are
content with this origin; whilst others, explaining the
visions in the garden of Alamoot as the effects of an intoxicating
herb, derive the name of the society from
hashish, the opiate of hemp-leaves, supposed to have
been so freely used by the sheikh in deluding his victims.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“How long did this strange society exist?” asked Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“After a time they divided into two branches; the
eastern one remaining at Alamoot, whilst the western
spread into Syria. Both branches became too powerful
and dangerous to be endured. After repeated attempts,
the eastern branch was destroyed by the Monguls, about
a century and a half after its foundation; whilst the
western branch lasted only fourteen years longer, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>fell about 1270, under the power of the Mamluke sultans
of Egypt.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was far easier to root out their strongholds than
their principles,” remarked Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was so found by their conquerors: the mountains
of Syria, especially, gave shelter to many of the society,
and the tenets of the order are still believed to linger
among a branch of the Koords. But come, we are wandering
from our tales, and if we do not leave off our remarks
Lathom will close the evening without another
specimen of the old story-teller.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We have not yet heard the moral of the magician’s
garden,” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The application is plain,” replied Lathom: “the
magician is the world; the luxuries and beauties of his
garden are the world’s rewards and riches; worldly people
think that they have grasped its gifts; anon, they
open their hands, and find them empty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But a short application, though over true,” remarked
Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I have rather condensed the old monk, and perhaps
wrongly, as the latter part of his moral reminds me
strongly of a passage in Gay’s fables. ‘The conjurer,’
says the old monk, ‘puts down a dish, but places nothing
in it. Then he begins to prate and mock the spectators
with fair words and long speeches. Soon he
inquires of them: What is in the dish? they look, and
it is full of pennies. These he distributes among the
bystanders; with thanks they receive his gifts, and
eagerly close their hands on them; anon, they open
their hands, and lo, there is nothing.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You allude,” said Herbert, “to Gay’s lines, where he
describes his conjurer performing his tricks.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Trick after trick deludes the train,</div>
      <div class='line'>He shakes his bag, and shows all fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>His fingers spread, and nothing there,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Then bids it rain with showers of gold;</div>
      <div class='line'>And now his ivory eggs are told.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Hardly so much,” replied Lathom, “as the four lines
where he says of <span class='fss'>FORTUNE</span>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘A purse she to the thief exposed;</div>
      <div class='line'>At once his ready fingers closed.</div>
      <div class='line'>He opes his fist, his treasure’s fled,</div>
      <div class='line'>He sees a halter in its stead.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>And now,” continued Lathom, “now for the original of
Guy, Earl of Warwick.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The original of a romance, that was a celebrated piece
in the time of Chaucer, and usually sung to the harp at
Christmas dinners and bridals, is indeed a curiosity,”
remarked Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“But how comes Sir Guy in the Latin stories?” said
Thompson; “does not Bishop Percy say it was of English
growth?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I cannot resolve the difficulty,” answered Lathom;
“we must admit that it was in French before the end of
the thirteenth century; when it came into its Latin dress,
must depend on that most difficult of all points, the date
and authorship of my volume of stories. But come from
where he will, you have here the story of the Champion
of Warwick.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SIR GUIDO, THE CRUSADER.</h3>

<p class='c014'>Centuries have gone by since the court
of the king of England was adorned by
two valorous knights named Guido and Tyrius.
Many a hard battle had they fought side by
side against the enemies of their king, for the
sake of the smiles of the fair ladies to whom
they had dedicated themselves. After several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>years of brilliant deeds of daring and numerous
perils, Sir Guido married the lady of his devotions.
Happy were the early days of his marriage,
for the knight and the lady loved each
other greatly. One night Sir Guido saw a vision,
as it were an angel of God talking with
him, and he was afraid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then said the angel: “Why weepest thou,
Sir Guido? arise, put on thy arms, and fight for
the holy cross.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Verily, Lord,” replied Sir Guido, “much
and often have I fought.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” replied the angel, “much, often, and
valiantly hast thou fought for the love of woman;
now fight for the love of God, the glory
of the holy cross. Contend against God’s enemies,
as thou hast against those of men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words the vision faded away, and
Sir Guido knew that he was called to battle in
the Holy Land against the infidels. Then he
turned to his wife and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Felicia, we must part, but for a time; I am
called to the Holy Land to fight under the banner
of the cross.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alas! alas! my lord,” replied Felicia, clasping
her husband in her arms and weeping hot
tears upon his neck; “alas! and wilt thou leave
me? death were to be preferred; then welcome
death.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>As she spoke she snatched up a dagger that
lay beside her, and would have killed herself
had not Sir Guido wrenched it from her grasp.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Felicia,” said the knight, “be comforted;
I am vowed to go to the Holy Land; bear with
it, my love; it is but for a time; be comforted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“God’s will be done,” murmured the lady.
“Take this ring, and as often as you look upon
it, in happiness or in misery, in joy or in woe,
think of Felicia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Guido gathered together his vassals, and
his friend, Sir Tyrius, added his to those of Sir
Guido, and thus combined they marched for the
Holy Land, and journeyed by land and not by
sea until they came to the borders of Dacia, a
Christian country overrun by the infidels.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brother,” said Sir Guido, “go thou to the
king of the country, and with thy good sword
rescue his kingdom from the power of the Saracen;
I will proceed to the Holy Land, and when
the foes of God are vanquished will rejoin you
here, and so together we will return to England.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even as you wish,” said Sir Tyrius; “I will
await your return here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus did the friends separate. Sir Guido
reached the Holy Land, and fought valiantly
against the Saracens. Many and dire were his
conflicts with the infidels, but in all of them he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>bore aloft the cross, and in his hands it never
bowed before the crescent. Every one spoke of
his deeds of arms, of his charity, and of his
kindness; the minstrels made songs of his exploits,
and spread his fame over the whole
Christian world. Sir Tyrius, too, was successful
in Dacia; by his aid the king regained his
throne, and the infidels were driven from the
kingdom. Rewards and thanks followed his
successes; the king regarded him as the preserver
of his throne, and considered no rewards
too great or too good for the Christian warrior.
The rewards of the good are ever sources of
envy to the wicked. So was it at the court of
the Dacian king. The prosperity of Sir Tyrius
was gall and wormwood to a knight of Dacia,
Sir Plebeus, who, until the coming of this
stranger, had been looked upon as the greatest
warrior of the Dacian people. To envy succeeded
hatred, to hatred falsehood. Treason,
he insinuated was in the mind of Tyrius; he
aspired to the crown which he had recovered
from the infidel.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alas! how easily do we credit falsehood, how
readily do we believe that every one is as wicked
as ourselves. The king believed the words of
Plebeus. He called his preserver before him,
charged him with treason, and upbraided him
with ingratitude.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Go,” said he, “leave my court. I have
honored thee much, I would have honored thee
yet more. Now I give thee thy life in return for
the valiant blows you struck for me; go in
peace, but in poverty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Miserable creature that I am,” murmured
Sir Tyrius; “whither shall I flee in this my
abject poverty?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sadly and slowly he wandered on, his eyes
cast down, his hands crossed upon his breast.
At last he sat down by the way-side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friend,” said a tall pilgrim, whose careworn
look showed how long he had been
journeying, “friend, whence comest thou?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father,” replied Tyrius, “I am of Rome;
years have I lived in this land, and now I seek
another home. Years have passed since my
companion parted with me but a few miles
from here; he sought the Holy Land, and
whether he be dead or alive I know not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friend,” replied the palmer, “I am wearied;
suffer me, by the memory of your friend, I pray
you, suffer me to repose my head on your knees,
that I may sleep awhile.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tyrius pitied the poor pilgrim, and acceded to
his request. The palmer’s cloak was drawn over
his face, so that he could distinguish but a portion
of his features.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the palmer slept, of a sudden a weasel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>small and white, leapt from out of his mouth,
and ran to a neighboring hill-side, where it
entered a small hole; after a time the creature
returned, and appeared to enter into the mouth
of the sleeping man. At that moment the
palmer awoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friend,” said he to Tyrius, “I have dreamed
a strange dream. Methought a weasel, small,
and white as snow, ran from out my mouth to a
hole in yonder hill, and thence returning, re-entered
my open mouth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father,” replied Tyrius, “it was no dream;
so did it appear to me also, as I sat and watched
you. What the weasel did in yonder hill I cannot
conjecture.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, let us arise and look, peradventure
we may find some good treasure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even as I thought,” continued the palmer,
when they entered the hole in the hill-side, that
led to a large cave; “see, a dragon dead, and
filled with gold; the treasure he was thus guarding
is our own; ay, too, a sword. What do we
read on its bright blade? ‘<i>By me shall Guido
overcome the enemies of Tyrius.</i>’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alas, Guido,” said Tyrius, “where art thou,
O my friend?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come,” said the palmer, “we will divide
the treasures; to you the piles of gold and
jewels; to me this sword.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“To thee the sword of Guido!” exclaimed
Tyrius; “nay.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To me the sword of Guido,” said the pilgrim,
interrupting the knight in his words, and gradually
raising the cowl of his dress from off his
face. “Yes, to me, Tyrius.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Guido, my friend, my brother!” cried the
knight, as he looked on the pilgrim’s features.
“And have we met, my brother? It is enough,
O my brother!” and the tears came in the eyes
of both.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Courage, courage, Tyrius; weep not, for I
will do battle with your enemy; with this
sword will I beat down thy foes; do you go to
your own home, and leave me to deal with your
traducers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The friends embraced and parted. Tyrius
went to his home with his treasure, and Guido
repaired to the Dacian king’s palace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who art thou, and from whence?” asked
the porter, as Sir Guido knocked at the king’s
gate.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A humble pilgrim from the holy sepulchre.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Enter, father, I crave thy blessing,” said
the porter, as he knelt before Sir Guido.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thou hast it, my son; peace be on thee and
this house; I seek the king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king sat at meat, and all his nobles were
round him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“Is the Holy Land at peace?” inquired the
king, as the pilgrim entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At peace, my lord; the holy sepulchre is
delivered from the infidel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ho, give place; sit, father; bring wine and
bread. Father, hast thou heard of a Christian
knight named Guido?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Both heard and seen him, my lord: we have
eaten of the same bread, and shared the same
couch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What say they of the Christian kings?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They say the Dacian king has regained his
kingdom and crown by the aid of a brave knight
of Rome, whom he promoted to great honor and
riches.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They say true, sir pilgrim,” said the king,
on whose brow an angry spot began to show.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They further say, that thou, O king, hast
driven away this good and brave knight, seduced
by the malice of one Plebeus, who has
poisoned your royal ear with his falsehoods.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“False pilgrim,” cried Plebeus, who stood by
the king’s chair; “false pilgrim, thou utterest
lies that thou darest not to defend with thy
life. That Tyrius was a traitor; he would have
dethroned our king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir knight,” replied Guido, “I have both
spoken the truth, and dare prove it; if thou art
Sir Plebeus, and sayest Tyrius was a traitor;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>go to, thou art a liar, and by the king’s leave I
will prove thy falsehood on thy body.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is well,” said the king; “let the wager of
battle decide the truth, and God defend the
right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give me, my lord, such arms as be necessary
for the field, and the ordeal of battle shall
prove the truth. Save this sword, I have no
armor.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be it so as you desire; to-morrow, at noon,
we will see this combat. Daughter, to thy care
I commit this pilgrim knight; see that he be
forthcoming by to-morrow’s noon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a bright day when the lists were prepared
for the contest; before the hour appointed
drew nigh, all the population of the
royal city poured towards the scene of the approaching
combat. Some trusted to the known
prowess of the Dacian knight; others sided with
the pilgrim, speculated upon who he was, and
wished him success for the sake of Tyrius.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haste thee, haste thee, sir pilgrim knight,”
said the king’s daughter, “thy adversary even
now stands in the lists, and exclaims: ‘False
pilgrim! why tarriest thou?’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Guido hastened to put on his armor, and
to gird his sword about him. At noon the king
entered the lists, the combatants took oath to
the justice of their quarrel, and prepared to engage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Long and arduous was the battle; Guido
pressed upon his adversary so fiercely that he
thirsted almost to death.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good pilgrim,” he said, “if thou wilt courteously
permit me to quench my thirst this
once, I will do the like to thee, shouldst thou
require it of me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I consent,” replied Guido.</p>

<p class='c007'>His thirst thus quenched, Plebeus renewed
the combat with redoubled animation. At
length Guido also thirsted, and claimed of his
adversary his promise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go to, fool! you shall taste no water but
by the strong hand,” replied the Dacian.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the strong hand then,” rejoined Guido,
“be it so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words he made towards the water,
guarding himself with his shield. As soon as
he gained the edge of the pond he jumped in,
drank freely of the water, and rushed out refreshed
and reinvigorated against his treacherous
foe. His prowess and his courage alike
deserted the Dacian, and he turned and fled.</p>

<p class='c007'>At that moment the king threw down his
sceptre, and the combat closed for that day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The king’s daughter led the knight to his
chamber, bound up his wounds, tended him
softly, prepared his evening meal, and smoothed
his bed with her own hands: a deep sleep soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>came over Sir Guido, for he was wearied with
the exertions of the combat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My sons,” said Plebeus to the seven stout
warriors that called him father, “my sons, if
to-morrow’s sun sees yonder pilgrim in the lists,
I die; never yet did I meet so stout an opponent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fear not, sir,” replied they all, “we will
take care of the pilgrim.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Guido slept heavily; at midnight his
chamber door was carefully opened, and the
sons of Plebeus crept into his room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He sleeps soundly,” whispered the eldest,
“how shall we dispose of him? if we slay him
here as he sleeps, what are we but dead men on
the morrow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Does not the sea flow beneath the window?”
asked one of the sons.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but if we touch him he will wake.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, let us take him bed and all and throw
him into the sea.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Sir Guido slept on, and knew not what was
plotting against him.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was midnight, and the moon shone brightly
on the sea. A fisherman beneath the wall of
the Dacian king’s palace was casting his nets,
when a sudden splash in the water arrested
his attention. “Halloa!” said he to himself,
“what villany is this? a bed floating on the sea,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>and a man on it; ho, friend! ho, I say! awake,
or be drowned!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where am I?” exclaimed Sir Guido, as he
awoke with the fisherman’s clamor. “Help;
friend,—I am sinking: I am the pilgrim that
fought yesterday in the lists—thanks—thanks,”
he continued, as he reached the fisherman’s
boat; “but how got I here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hardly know: just now I heard a splash,
looked round, and by the moon’s light saw you
and your bed floating on the water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! well, the treachery has failed, good
friend; to-morrow will confound the traitors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The morrow came in fair and bright; again
the people hastened to the lists, eager to see the
issue of this wondrous combat. The king was
seated, the lists were ready, and the heralds
sounded. Then stept forth Sir Plebeus with
his visor up, and a fair and smiling countenance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord the king,” said the Dacian champion,
as he bowed before the king’s throne, “I
demand the combat with the pilgrim.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is well, Sir Plebeus—ho, herald! go to
my daughter, and demand of her the pilgrim
knight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The princess is even now coming to the
royal presence,” replied the herald, as the
crowd formed a lane, through which the king’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>daughter was seen approaching her father’s
throne, with a meek and sorrowful aspect.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My child,” said the Dacian king, “where is
the pilgrim knight, the champion of Sir Tyrius?
We await his coming forth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father, and dear lord,” replied the maiden,
“I know not whither he is gone; but last night
I left him in deep sleep in his chamber, and
now neither he nor his bed whereon he slept
are to be found.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cowardly boaster!” exclaimed Sir Plebeus,
“dares he not meet me in the list? The coward
has fled.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is not so, my lord,” exclaimed a poor
man in the crowd; “he has not fled.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! how sayest thou?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even now he sleeps at my hut; last night I
found him floating on his bed beneath the
palace wall; I took him into my boat, and he is
safe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thou hast done well; summon him to the
list. Sir Plebeus, you shall not be disappointed
of your combat. See, even now your adversary
comes. Now, marshals, arm the stranger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, my good lord,” said the Dacian knight,
“press not on the pilgrim; I pray you, my
lord, give him time to recruit his strength.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not for a minute, sir knight,” exclaimed
the pilgrim as he entered the lists and hastened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>to don his armor; “not for a minute—I have
much to reckon with you: remember last
night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The combat was short: each knight struck
twice without fatal effect; the pilgrim’s third
blow ended the battle, and the Dacian rolled on
the ground a headless corpse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir Pilgrim,” said the king, as he knelt
before the throne, “God has defended the
right; even now have I been told of the treachery
of that senseless corpse, and of the villany
of his sons towards thee; they now are going to
their reward—to death. Come, sir knight, for
thy sake I restore Sir Tyrius, renew his honors,
and add to them those which you so steadfastly
refuse. One boon I ask before you leave our
court and our kingdom: disclose thy name;
let me and my people know to whom they owe
the punishment of a traitor and the defence of
their best friend, their former preserver.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” replied the pilgrim, “my name is
not unknown to you; I am the knight of the
Holy Land—the Guido of whom men speak.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Loud were the exclamations with which that
famous name was hailed by the assembled
Dacians, as their king fell on the pilgrim’s
neck and embraced him as a brother.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seven years had passed since Guido left his
castle and sailed for the Holy Land. Day by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>day did Felicia minister to the poor and bestow
alms on every applicant, with this one request,
that they would pray for the safety of her husband,
Sir Guido, and that once more before her
death she might rejoice in his presence. Felicia
stood at her castle gate, and the inner court-yard
was filled with her poor pensioners.
One by one she accosted them and bade her
almoner give to each his accustomed alms.
Her young son ran by his mother’s side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother, dear mother,” said the child, as he
heard Felicia commend Sir Guido to the prayers
of the poor men, “is it not my father for whom
you ask these poor people to pray?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, my child; seven years have passed
since he left me; but a few months had we been
married before God summoned him to the Holy
Land, and he took the cross and went against
the infidel.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As she thus spoke to her son, Felicia drew
nigh to a tall pilgrim who stood apart from the
rest of the poor people. She gave him the alms,
and asked of him his prayers for her husband’s
return. Low bowed the pilgrim his head, but
not a word did he speak as the lady passed onwards.
Her son followed after Felicia; as he
passed the pilgrim, he bowed himself forward
and embraced the youth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God give thee grace,” said he with a trembling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>voice, “God give thee grace to do his
will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, father, for thy blessing,” said
Felicia; “can I do aught to reward thy good
wishes?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Lady,” said the pilgrim in a low, stifled
voice, “I crave the small hermitage below the
eagle’s rock; there let me live and die.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha!” exclaimed Felicia, “the eagle’s rock;
art thou of this place, good father, that thou
knowest the name so well?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was of thy people once, fair lady; now I
am God’s poor servant.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be it as thou desirest; go, father, and pray
for this house and its long-lost master.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who could see the pilgrim’s face saw
the tears start in his eyes as he accepted
Felicia’s gift and turned towards his lonely
hermitage. Many years did he live there,
many a time did he come to the castle yard,
and his daily companion was Felicia’s child,
Sir Guido’s son. Day after day did he talk to
him of adventures of knights in the Holy Land,
of those that had fallen fighting for the sepulchre,
and those who had passed through the
fiery ordeal of that expedition. At last death
came upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear boy,” said he to Sir Guido’s son,
“take this ring to thy mother, and bid her, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>she would see me ere I die, come hither
quickly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mother, dear mother,” said the youth when
he entered Felicia’s chamber, “the good pilgrim
is sorely ill; he sends you this ring, and bids
you see him ere he die.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Felicia cast one look upon the ring. “Haste,
haste, my child!” she exclaimed, “it is my
lord’s, your father’s ring; come, come to the
forest!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Quickly as she rushed to the hermitage, she
found but the dead body of her husband.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woe, woe is me!” she exclaimed, casting
herself on the cold corpse, “woe, woe is me!
where are now my alms? My husband asked
charity of me and I knew him not; thy father
talked with thee, my child, he embraced thee,
and thou knewest him not. O Guido! thou
didst look upon thy wife, and didst not
tremble; thou didst look upon thy child, and
kissed him, and blessed him; alas, alas! my
husband.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“I should be loth to agree with Percy, that so beautiful
a tale should have been resigned to children,” said Herbert,
as soon as Lathom had concluded his version of the
old tale.</p>

<p class='c012'>“No wonder that the pilgrimage of the warrior was
such a favorite with all nations, as to be claimed by
nearly all as peculiarly their own,” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It was very early translated into French, and is alluded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>to in a Spanish romance, written somewhere
about 1430. But now, that, as the old ballad says,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘The story is brought to an end,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of Guy, the bold baron of price,</div>
      <div class='line'>And of the fair maid Felice,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>we will conclude our evening with some account of its
applications, as intended by the monk. Sir Guido was
symbolical of our Saviour, Felicia of the soul, and Tyrius
of man in general. By the weasel was meant the prophets,
and especially the Baptist, as prophesying the coming
of the Saviour. The mountain is the world, the
dead dragon the old law of Moses, and the gold within
it the Ten Commandments. The sword represented
authority, the seven deadly sins were symbolized in the
sons of Plebeus, and the good fisherman was the representative
of the Holy Spirit.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“There remains one character yet unexplained—the
king’s daughter,” remarked Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The explanation of her duties is peculiar to the
religion of the age in which the tale was written; the
Roman Catholic easily recognized in the king’s daughter
the Virgin Mary.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“The attention of the king’s daughter to the wounded
knight,” remarked Herbert, “reminds me strongly
of the patriarchal habits described by Homer in his
Odyssey. The daughter of Nestor thinks it no disgrace
or indelicacy to attend to the bath of the wandering
Telemachus, and Helen herself seems to have performed
a like office for his father.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The tales of chivalry are replete with instances of
these simple manners,” rejoined Lathom; “the king’s
daughter, the fair virgin princess, is ever the kind attendant
on the honored guest, prepares his bath after
the fatigues of the day, and ministers to his wounds by
her medicinal skill.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your old monk’s tales,” said Thompson, “have no
little merit, as illustrations of the manners and habits of
the middle ages.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Indeed, the light is curious that is thrown by these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>tales on the habits of the middle ages,” answered Lathom;
“in these vivid and strongly delineated fictions, I
seem to fight, to tilt, to make love and war, to perform
penances, and to witness miracles with the actors themselves.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We cannot but feel, however,” remarked Herbert,
“that we are more inclined to laugh at the regulations
of their chivalry, than to appreciate them. The
absurd penances with which imaginable crimes were
visited in those days cannot but raise a smile, whilst
the utter carelessness with which enormous sins were
committed, excites extreme regret.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Some illustrations of witchcraft and sorcery; that
most prevalent belief, from the middle ages, to the days
of the sapient James the First.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Among all curious discoveries, this would be the
most curious,” said Herbert: “to find a people in whom
there never has existed a belief that human beings could
be gifted with supernatural powers, for the purpose of
accomplishing some good or evil object of their desire.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Wherever Christianity spread, witchcraft must be
regarded as a recognized form in which the powers of
evil contended with the Almighty.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Of what sex is your witch?” asked Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Oh, in this case, the good and the bad sorcerers are
both of the male sex.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your writer, therefore,” replied Thompson, “does
not seem to have held the ungallant notions of Sprenger,
that from the natural inferiority of their minds, and
wickedness of their hearts, the Devil always preferred
women for his agents. But to the story.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well, then, as the old chronicler would say, here
begins the tale of</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>
  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“THE KNIGHT AND THE NECROMANCER.”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Among the knights that graced the court of
the Emperor Titus, there was one whom
all men agreed in calling the <span class='fss'>GOOD KNIGHT</span>.
For some years he had been married to one
whose beauty was her fairest portion, for she
loved not the knight, her husband, but delighted
in the company of others, and would gladly
have devised his death, that she might marry
another courtier.</p>

<p class='c007'>The good knight could not fail of discovering
the wickedness of his wife. Ofttimes did he
remonstrate with her; but to all he said, she
turned a deaf ear, and would not return the
affection he felt, for one so unworthy of his love.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear wife,” said the good knight, “I go
to the Holy Land, to perform a vow: I leave
you to your own discretion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The knight had no sooner embarked, than
the lady sent for one of her lovers, a clever
sorcerer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Know,” said she to him, when he arrived at
the house, “my husband has sailed for the Holy
Land; we live together; ay, and for all our
lives, if you will but compass his death; for I
love him not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is danger,” replied the necromancer;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“but, for the sake of thee and thy love, I will
endeavor to perform your wishes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then took he wax and herbs, gathered at dead
of night in secret places, and unguents made of
unknown ingredients, and moulded a figure of
the good knight, inscribing it with his name,
placing it before him, against the wall of the
lady’s chamber.</p>

<p class='c007'>The good knight commenced his pilgrimage
towards the Holy Land, and wist not what the
lady and her lover were plotting against him
and his dear life. As he descended towards the
vessel in which he was to embark, he observed
a man of some age, and of lofty and commanding
stature, regarding him with interest. A
long robe covered him, and its hood drawn over
the face, concealed, in a great degree, the
features of the wearer. At last the old man
approached the knight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good friend,” said he, “I have a secret to
communicate to thee.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say on, good father,” rejoined the knight,
“what wouldest thou with me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I would preserve thee from death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, father, that is in God’s hands; I fight
not against his will.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To-day, then, thou diest; unless thou obeyest
my commands:—and, listen, the lover of
thy unfaithful wife is thy murderer.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“Good sir,” replied the knight, “I perceive
thou art a wise man; what shall I do to escape
this sudden death?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Follow, and obey me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Many and winding were the streets through
which the good knight followed his mysterious
guide. At last they reached a dark, dismal-looking
house, apparently without any inhabitant.
The guide pressed his foot on the doorstep,
and the door slowly opened, closing again
as the knight followed the old man into the
house. All was darkness, but the guide seized
the knight’s hand and led him up the tottering
staircase to a large room, in which were many
strange books and figures of men and animals,
interspersed with symbolic emblems of triangles
and circles, whose meaning was known to that
aged man alone. In the midst of the room was
a table, on which burned a lamp without a wick
or a reservoir of oil, for it fed on a vapor that
was lighter than air, and was invisible to the
eye. The old man spoke some words, to the
knight unknown; in a moment the floor clave
asunder, and a bath, on whose sides the same
mystic symbols were written as on the walls of
the room, arose from beneath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Prepare to bathe,” said the old man, opening
a book on the table, and taking a bright
mirror from a casket.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>No sooner had the knight entered the bath
than the old man gave him a mirror and bid
him look into it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What seest thou?” asked he of the knight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see my own chamber; my wife is there,
and Maleficus, the greatest sorcerer in Rome.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What does the sorcerer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He kneads wax and other ingredients; he
hath made a figure of me, and written under it
my name; even now he fastens it against the
wall of my chamber.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look again,” said the old man; “what does
he?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He takes a bow; he fits an arrow to the
string; he aims at the effigy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look on: as you love your life, when that
arrow leaves the string, plunge beneath the
water till you hear me call.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He shoots!” exclaimed the knight as he
dived beneath the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come out; look again at the mirror; what
seest thou?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“An arrow is sticking in the wall, by the side
of the figure. The sorcerer seems angry; he
draws out the arrow, and prepares to shoot
again from a nearer place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As you value your life, do as before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the good knight plunged, and at the old
man’s call resumed his inspection of the mirror.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“What seest thou now?” asked the old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maleficus has again missed the image; he
makes great lamentations; he says to my wife:
‘If I miss the third time, I die’; he goes nearer
to the image, and prepares to shoot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Plunge!” cried the old man; and then,
after a time: “Raise thyself, and look again;
why laughest thou?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To see the reward of the wicked; the arrow
has missed, rebounded from the wall, and
pierced the sorcerer; he faints, he dies, my
wife stands over his body, and weeps; she
digs a hole under the bed, and buries the
body.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Arise, sir knight: resume your apparel,
and give God thanks for your great deliverance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A year and more elapsed before the good
knight returned from his pilgrimage. His wife
welcomed him with smiles and every appearance
of pleasure. For a few days the knight
concealed his knowledge of his wife’s conduct.
At length he summoned all his and her kinsfolk,
and they feasted in commemoration of his
return from his dangerous pilgrimage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brother,” said the knight during the feast,
“how is it that I neither hear nor see aught of
Maleficus, the great magician?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He disappeared, we know not whither, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>very day that you departed for your pilgrimage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And where did he die?” asked the knight,
with a look at his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We know not that he is dead,” replied the
guests.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How should a sorcerer die?” asked the
knight’s wife with a sneer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If not dead, why did you bury him?” rejoined
the knight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bury him! what meanest thou, my lord? I
bury him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you bury him,” said the knight,
calmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Brothers, he is mad,” exclaimed the lady,
turning pale and trembling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woman,” replied the knight, rising, and
seizing the lady by the wrist, “woman, I am
not mad. Hear ye all: this woman loved Maleficus;
she called him here the day I sailed;
she devised with him my death; but God struck
him with that death he would have prepared for
me, and now he lies buried in my chamber.
Come, let us see this great wonder.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The hiding-place of the body was opened,
and the remains found where the knight had
said; then did he declare before the judges and
the people the great crimes of his wife; and the
judges condemned her to death at the stake,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>and bade the executioner scatter her ashes to
the four winds of heaven.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Few practices were more prevalent among the
witches than that which your tale illustrates, of effecting
the death of an enemy through the medium of an enchanted
image of the person intended to be affected,”
said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“As old Ben Jonson sings:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘With pictures full,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of wax and wool,</div>
      <div class='line'>Their livers I stick,</div>
      <div class='line'>With needles quick.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Yes,” said Herbert; “it was a very approved method
to melt a waxen image before the fire, under the idea
that the person by it represented would pine away, as
the figure melted; or to stick pins and needles into the
heart or less vital parts of the waxen resemblance, with
the hopes of affecting, by disease and pain, the portions
of the human being thus represented and treated.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In one of the old ballad romances in which Alexander
is celebrated, we find a full account of the wondrous
puppets of a king and magician named Nectabanus. I
will read you the old verses.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Barons were whilhome wise and good,</div>
      <div class='line'>That this art well understood;</div>
      <div class='line'>And one there was, Nectabanus,</div>
      <div class='line'>Wise in this art, and malicious;</div>
      <div class='line'>When king or earl came on him to war,</div>
      <div class='line'>Quick he looked on the star;</div>
      <div class='line'>Of wax, made him puppets,</div>
      <div class='line'>And made them fight with bats (<i>clubs</i>);</div>
      <div class='line'>And so he learned <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je vous dis</span></i>,</div>
      <div class='line'>Aye to quell his enemy</div>
      <div class='line'>With charms and with conjurisons:</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus he assayed the regions,</div>
      <div class='line'>That him came for to assail,</div>
      <div class='line'>In very manner of battail;</div>
      <div class='line'>By clear candle in the night,</div>
      <div class='line'>He made each one with other fight.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“No bad way,” said Thompson, “of testing the advantage
of that royal and national luxury—war.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The rhymer makes his charms successful, especially
in the case of one King Philip, a great and powerful
prince, who brought nine-and-twenty great lords to battle
against Nectabanus. Once put into his charmed
basin, the magician saw the end of the battle, the defeat
and death of his enemy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The old Romans had as much fear of the waxen
image, as good King James,” remarked Herbert; “and
were as firm believers in the feats of Canidia over the enchanted
model, as the Scottish King in the modelling of
his national wiches, and the secret cavern on the hill,
where Satan and his imps manufacture devils’ arrows
to shoot at the enemies of the witches.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sympathia Magica</span> works wondrous charms,’ says
Scott; and so before him dreamt the Arabian philosophers,
and the royal witch-finder, who founds his arguments
against waxen images on the doctrine of sympathy,”
said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is worth remarking,” said Herbert, “how witchcraft
degenerated, not in its powers, but in its persons
of the supposed witches. Joan of Arc, the wife of the
protector Somerset, the mistress of Richard III., were in
early days deemed worthy of being punished as witches.
In later days, the charge was confined to the oldest, the
ugliest, and generally the poorest crone in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“With the fashion of political-witchcraft, the custom
of charging persons of rank with the crime, died
away,” replied Lathom. “Instead of torturing images,
or raising spirits for the sake of crowns and thrones, the
witches became content to tease a neighbor’s child, or
render a farmer’s cow barren. The last instance of such
a charge against a person of rank, is the case of the
Countess of Essex. The charges of sorcery, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>formed but a small portion of the accusations against the
countess.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are forgetting the moral,” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“It is short and plain,” answered Lathom, “and intended
to be illustrative of the advantage of the confession
of sins. The good knight is the soul of man, and his
wicked wife the flesh of his body. The pilgrimage represents
our good deeds. The wise magician, a prudent
priest. Maleficus stands as the representative of the
Devil, and the image is human pride and vanity; add to
these the bath of confession, and the mirror of the sacred
writings, by which the arrows of sin are warded off, and
the allegory is complete.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Does your storehouse afford another magical tale?”
asked Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Many more; I will read one that is short, but curious,
from its being founded on a generally received legend of
the monk Gerbert, afterwards Pope Sylvester. I will
call it, for want of a better name,</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“THE CLERK AND THE IMAGE.”</h3>

<p class='c014'>In the city of Rome stood an image: its
posture was erect, with the right hand extended;
on the middle finger of the outstretched
hand was written: “<span class='sc'>Strike here.</span>” Years
and years had the image stood there, and no
one knew the secret of the inscription. Many
wise men from every land came and looked at
the statue, and many were the solutions of the
mystery attempted by them; each man was
satisfied with his own conclusion, but no one
else agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Among the many that attempted to unravel
the mystery of the figure was a certain priest.
As he looked at the image, he noticed that
when the sun shone on the figure, the shadow
of the outstretched finger was discernible on the
ground at some distance from the statue. He
marked the spot, and waited until the night was
come; at midnight, he began to dig where the
shadow ceased; for three feet he found nothing
but earth and stones; he renewed his labor, and
felt his spade strike against something hard; he
continued his work with greater zeal, and found
a trap-door, which he soon cleared, and proceeded
to raise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Below the door, a flight of marble steps descended
into the earth, and a bright light
streamed upward from below. Casting down
his spade, the priest descended; at the foot of
the stairs he entered a vast hall; a number of
men, habited in costly apparel, and sitting in
solemn silence, occupied the centre; around,
and on every side, were riches innumerable:
piles of gold and enamelled vases; rich and
glittering robes, and heaps of jewels of the
brightest hue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hall was lighted by one jewel alone; a
carbuncle so bright, so dazzling, that the priest
could hardly bear to gaze upon it, where it
stood in a corner of the hall. At the opposite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>end of the hall stood an armed archer; his bow
was strung, and the arrow fitted to the string,
and he seemed to take aim at the carbuncle; his
brow blazed with reflected light, and on it was
written: “<i>I am, that I am; my shaft is inevitable:
yon glittering jewel cannot escape its
stroke.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Beyond the great hall appeared another chamber,
into which the priest, amazed at what he
saw, entered. It was fitted as a bedchamber,
couches of every kind ornamented it, and many
beautiful women, arrayed in robes as costly as
those worn in the great hall, occupied the
chamber. Here too all was mute; the beautiful
damsels sat in silence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still the priest went onward. There were
rooms after rooms, stables filled with horses
and asses, and granaries stored with abundant
forage. He placed his hand on the horses, they
were cold, lifeless stone. Servants stood round
about, their lips were closed—all was silent as
the grave; and yet what was there wanting—what
but life?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have seen to-day what no man wall believe,”
said the priest, as he re-entered the
great hall; “let me take something whereby to
prove the credit of my story.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he thus spake to himself, he saw some
vases and jewel-handed knives on a marble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>table beside him; he raised his hand, he clasped
them, he placed them in the bosom of his
garment—all was dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>The archer had shot with his arrow; the carbuncle
was broken into a thousand pieces—a
thick darkness covered the place; hour after
hour he wandered about the halls and passages—all
was dark—all was cold—all was desolate;
the stairs seemed to have fled, he found no opening,
and he laid him down and died a miserable
death, amid those piles of gold and jewels, his
only companions the lifeless images of stone.
His secret died with him.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Spenser in his Fairy Queen seems to have had some
such tale as this in his mind, in his scene in the House
of Riches,” remarked Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“You allude to the fiend watching Sir Gouyon, and
hoping that he will be tempted to snatch some of the
treasures of the subterraneous palace, so freely displayed
to his view.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sir Gouyon fares better than your priest,” replied
Herbert; he resists the temptation, and escapes the
threatened doom; as the poet says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Thereat the fiend his gnashing teeth did grate,</div>
      <div class='line'>And grieved so long to lack his greedy prey;</div>
      <div class='line'>For well he weened, that so glorious bait</div>
      <div class='line'>Would tempt his guest to take thereof assay;</div>
      <div class='line'>Had he so done, he had him snatched away,</div>
      <div class='line'>More light than Culver in the falcon’s fist.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Pope Sylvester, I presume,” said Thompson, “was a
clever mechanician, and a good astronomer, as far as
knowledge extended in his day.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Precisely so, and hence all the wondrous tales of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>his magic,” rejoined Lathom. “Born in France, and
naturally of an acquisitive mind, he proceeded to Spain,
to gain in the Saracenic university of Seville some little
of the Eastern sciences. Arithmetic and astronomy, or,
as Malmesbury calls the last, astrology, were then flourishing
in Spain, and when introduced by him into his
native country, soon gained for him the reputation of a
magician.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Friar Bacon experienced in this country,” remarked
Herbert, “that a knowledge of mechanics sufficient to
create automatons, of acoustics to regulate the transmission
of sounds through long, concealed pipes, and of
astronomy to attempt some predictions of the weather
from planetary movements, was quite enough to ensure
him the name of magician among our rude ancestors.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“One of the magic arts attributed to Gerbert,” remarked
Lathom, “clearly indicates, that a knowledge of
mechanism was the source of this reputation in his case.
Malmesbury tells us that Gerbert framed a bridge, beyond
which were golden horses of gigantic size, with
riders of gold, richly glittering with jewels and embroidery.
A party attempted to pass the bridge, in order
to steal the treasures on the further side. As the first
stept on the bridge, it rose gradually in the air, and stood
perpendicularly on one end. A brazen man rose from
beneath, and as he struck the water with a mace of brass,
the sky was overshadowed, and all was thick darkness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Setting aside the darkness,” said Thompson, “the
result of accident, or an addition of the chroniclers, a
little clever mechanism will account for the movable
bridge of Gerbert.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The same explanation applies to the ever-burning
lamp of the Rosicrucians, held in the hand of a figure
armed with a mace, with which he dashes the lamp to
atoms, on the entrance of any person into the secret
vault.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“Most undoubtedly, Herbert,” said Thompson; “for
in this instance, the legend describes the figure as raising
his hand at the first step of the intruder, preparing
to strike as he draws nearer and nearer, and at last,
when almost within reach, the secret springs on which
he is walking dash down the armed hand of the figure,
and the lamp and the secret perish in darkness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The tales of natural magic,” said Herbert, “remind
me of the legends of one of the Jameses of Scotland, in
the subterraneous cavern of Halidon Hill.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I hardly know to what legend you allude,” replied
Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The one in which the king enters a long hall, where
a hundred knights stand on either side, each with his
armor on, and his horse ready caparisoned by his side.
At the end of the hall stand a bugle and a sword. All is
silence; the knights stand as statues, and their warhorses
do not seem to breathe. The whole charm depends
upon which is performed first, the bugle blown, or
the sword drawn from its scabbard. The king seizes
the bugle; the effect is that the whole melts into darkness,
and the charm is gone.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As you have led the way to traditions of the northern
part of our island,” said Lathom, “one form, if not the
original one of the legend, which Scott has worked up in
his Marmion, will not be out of place. I allude to the
encounter of Marmion with De Wilton, under the guise
of the spectral champion of the Pictish camp.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your old monk’s book would have been a treasure to
Sir Walter Scott,” said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“That he would duly have appreciated its contents,
no one can doubt,” replied Lathom, “but he was so well
read in the later forms of the legends, which he would
have found in its pages, that though apparently unknown
to him, he required but little of its aid. Our
writer would wish his readers to see in this legend an allegory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>of the discomfiture of the Devil armed with
pride, by the Christian armed with faith. I will call it

<h3 class='c013'>“THE DEMON KNIGHT OF THE VANDAL CAMP.”</h3>

<p class='c014'>On the borders of the diocese of Ely, stands
an old castle, now crumbling into ruins,
below which is a place called by the people
Wandlesbury; commemorating by this name
the camp of the Vandals, which they pitched
hard by this castle, after laying waste the country
and cruelly slaughtering the inhabitants.
The camp was on the summit of a hill, on a
round plain; round about it ran a trench
which</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in10'>“The Vandal race</div>
      <div class='line'>——long since in blood did trace;</div>
      <div class='line'>The moor around was brown and bare,</div>
      <div class='line'>The space within was green and fair,</div>
      <div class='line'>The spot the village children knew,</div>
      <div class='line'>For there the wild flowers earliest grew;</div>
      <div class='line'>But wo betide the wandering wight,</div>
      <div class='line'>That treads its circle in the night!</div>
      <div class='line'>The breadth across, a bow-shot clear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gives ample space for full career:</div>
      <div class='line'>Opposed to the four points of heaven,</div>
      <div class='line'>By four deep gaps was entrance given.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Wo indeed to the adventurous man who dared
to go armed into that camp, and call upon an
adversary to meet him! Even as he called, another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>knight rode into the camp, armed at all
points, and met the challenger in combat. The
encounter was always fatal to one of the combatants.</p>

<p class='c007'>The knight Albert sat in the hall of the castle
of Wandlesbury, and shared the hospitality of
the lord. At night, after supper, the household
closed round the great fire, and each man in his
turn told his tale of arms, love, or sorcery. The
demon knight of the Vandal camp figured in
many a tale, and Albert hastened to prove the
truth of the legend. It was in vain that the lord
of the castle endeavored to dissuade his guest
from seeking the phantom knight. Armed at
all points, the English knight sallied from the
castle gate; and his trusty squire, a youth of
noble blood, rode by his master’s side.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some hours passed: the hall was sadly silent
during the knight’s absence, for they all feared
the worst for him; anon, a horn was heard at
the gate, the warder hastened to open the doors,
and the knight rode into the castle court; his
squire followed him close, and he led by the
bridle a horse of perfect form and figure, of
enormous size, and coal-black.</p>

<p class='c007'>The knight hastened to the hall; all clustered
round him to hear his tale; but the good lord
of the castle bade them first release him of his
armor, and bring in refreshment. One by one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>the pieces of his armor were taken off, and
neither wound nor bruise appeared; at last they
proceeded to take off one of his cuishes; it was
filled with blood, and even then a few drops
were seen to ooze from a slight wound in the
thigh. His wound dressed, his fatigue refreshed
with good wine and meat, the lord of the castle
requested the knight’s account of his meeting
with the demon champion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” replied the English knight, “you
know how, in despite of your earnest remonstrances,
I rode from your castle gate. The
moon was bright and clear, and I soon reached
the entrance of the Vandal camp; without a
pause I rode in and blew my bugle.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Methought an answer met my ear,—</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet was the blast so low and drear,</div>
      <div class='line'>So hollow and so faintly blown,</div>
      <div class='line'>It might be echo of my own.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>I waited for a moment in doubt.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Then sudden in the ring I view,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>In form distinct of shape and hue,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>A mounted champion rise.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Without a word the demon prepared for the
charge; I raised my shield, couched my lance,
and rushed to the attaint; we both staggered
with the charge; our lances broke in half, but
the points glided harmlessly from our armor.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>I still pressed on, and my adversary’s horse
stumbled and fell; the demon was rolled on the
ground. In a moment I was by his side, and
seized his horse’s rein; the demon seemed to
revive; he saw my action, snatched a portion
of his broken lance, and darted it at me as a
javelin. It struck me on my thigh, but in my
eagerness I felt it not. In a moment</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘He seem’d to vanish from my sight:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The moonbeam droop’d, and deepest night</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Sunk down upon the heath.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Had I not that dark black horse as a witness of
the combat, I should begin to doubt whether I
had met the demon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us see the demon’s steed,” said the old
lord, after he had thanked the knight for his
relation of the adventure; “even now the dawn
is about to break, and we must seek some little
rest before day shines out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the court-yard they found the black steed;
his eye lustrous, his neck proudly arched, his
coat of shining black, and a glittering war
saddle on his back. The first streaks of the
dawn began to appear as they entered the castle
yard; the black steed grew restless, and tried
to break from the hands of the groom; he
champed his bit, snorted as in pain and anger,
and struck the ground with his feet, until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>sparks flew. The cock crowed—the black steed
had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every year, on the self-same night, at that
self-same hour, did the wound of the English
knight burst out afresh, and torment him with
severe anguish; to his dying day he bore this
memorial of his encounter with the demon
champion of the Vandal camp.</p>

<p class='c015'>“You have made good use of Scott’s version of the
tale in Marmion,” said Thompson, “to whom I should
think your version of the story was hardly known.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“No; if I remember rightly, he gives the old Durham
tale of Ralph Bulmer as its immediate source, and the
strange tale of the Bohemian knights as related by Heywood,
in his Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The introduction to the story recalls the custom so
adroitly used by Chaucer to introduce his Canterbury
tales,” remarked Herbert; “tale-telling round the fire.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“When there was neither juggler nor minstrel present,”
replied Lathom, “it seems to have been the custom
of our ancestors to entertain themselves by relating
or hearing a series of adventures.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So that Chaucer’s plan, at first sight so ingenious an
invention, is in truth an equally ingenious adaptation of
an ancient fashion.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But to return to our demonology,” said Lathom;
“what notion was more common than that spirits could
assume the human form, and live on earth, and mingle
as mortals in social life? This belief we find illustrated
by the author or authors of the Gesta.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The stay, however, of these spirits is generally but a
lease of life for so many years,” remarked Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Generally; but not in the case which my author
gravely lays down as true, under the title of</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>
  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“THE SEDUCTIONS OF THE EVIL ONE.”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It often happens that the devils are permitted
to transform themselves into angels of
light, or to assume the human form, in order to
foster in human hearts whatever is wicked. So
did it happen in France, when Valentine was
bishop of Arles.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the very borders of his diocese stood a
knight’s castle, with lofty and strong battlements.
The knight had travelled in many
lands, and seen many nations that none others
had looked upon or heard of. He was a good
man, and a constant attendant on the services
of the Church. His wife was very fair to look
upon; her figure was light and tall; her face
delicately white, and her eyes ever bright, and
sparkling with almost unearthly brilliancy.
Attracted by cries of distress, whilst on one of
his distant pilgrimages, he had hastened into a
dark wood, where he discovered this fair lady,
almost denuded of her garments, bound to
a tree, and being beaten with rods by two men
of fierce countenances and powerful frames.</p>

<p class='c007'>His sword flashed in the air as the knight rode
against the men; with one blow he struck down
the nearest of the lady’s torturers; with the
second he pierced the breast of the other monster;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>whilst with a third stroke of his trenchant
blade he cut in pieces the cords that bound the
lady to the tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lady’s tale was simple: she was the
daughter of a powerful prince of a far-off land;
had been seized by those in whose hands the
knight discovered her; carried for days and
months over seas and lands, and at last bound
to the tree, and scourged because she would not
yield to the desires of her tormentors. She
knew not where her father’s kingdom lay, and
its name was unknown even to the knight,
though he had travelled far and often.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a time, the knight married the lady of
the wood; happy were they by their union, for
he loved her dearly, and the lady seemed to return
his love. One thing alone grieved the
good knight. Every day that she came to the
service of the Church, she stayed no longer
than the beginning of the consecration of the
elements of the Sacrament. Often and often
had the good knight remonstrated with his wife
on her conduct, and sought from her some
reason for her action. There was ever some excuse,
but it was always unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>One holiday the knight and the lady were at
church. The priest was proceeding to the
celebration of the Sacrament, and the lady
rose as usual.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Nay,” said the knight, forcibly arresting his
wife’s departure; “nay, not for this once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The lady struggled, her eyes gleamed with
redoubled brilliancy, and her whole body
seemed wrung with violent pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the name of God, depart not,” said the
knight.</p>

<p class='c007'>That holy name was all-powerful. The bodily
form of the lady melted away, and was seen no
more; whilst, with a cry of anguish and of terror,
an evil spirit of monstrous form rose from
the ground, clave the chapel roof asunder, and
disappeared in the air.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Such stories might be multiplied by hundreds,” said
Herbert. “Every country has its good and evil angels
that live among men and assume their forms.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It illustrates the curious fact,” remarked Lathom,
“that the earliest accusations of sorcery in Christian
ages are connected with relapses from the faith of Christ.
The Anglo-Saxon laws against witchcraft are levelled
against those who still adhered to the heathen practices
of their ancestors, or sought to combine the pure faith of
the Bible with the superstitions of their ancestral idolatry.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Was not such the fact in the south of Europe?” said
Herbert; “the still lingering worship of the gods and
goddesses of the woods was visited as sorcery. The demons
do but occupy their places under forms, and with
opinions, gradually adapted to the religious opinions of
the age.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Many a secret meeting for the worship of God has
been made the foundation of the mysteries of a witch’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Sabbath,” said Lathom; “sorcery was a common charge
against the early Christians when they met in their secret
caves and hiding-places; it was an equally current accusation
centuries afterwards, when the Albigenses and
Waldenses held their religious assemblages in secret, for
fear of the power of that Church whose teaching they
seceded from.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The same charges were made, in Sweden and Scotland,
in the seventeenth century, against witches, as
four centuries before, so little changed is superstition,”
said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We must beat a truce,” said Lathom, “and be content
to leave the rest of our illustrations of natural
magic, witchcraft, and demoniacal agency, until our
next meeting.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Good-night, then,” said Thompson; “remember, the
witches’ time of night approaches—</p>

  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>THE THREE MAXIMS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>There was an emperor of Rome named
Domitian, a good and a wise prince, who
suffered no offenders to escape. There was a
high feast in his hall, the tables glittered with
gold and silver, and groaned with plenteous
provision; his nobles feasted with him—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And ’twas merry with all</div>
      <div class='line'>In the king’s great hall,</div>
      <div class='line'>When his nobles and kinsmen, great and small,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Were keeping their Christmas holiday.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>The porter in his lodge made his fire blaze
brightly, and solaced himself with Christmas
cheer, every now and then grumbling at his office,
that kept him from the gayeties of the retainers’
hall. The wind blew cold, the sleet fell
quick, as the bell of the king’s gate sounded
heavy and dull.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who comes now?” grumbled the porter;
“a pretty night to turn out from fire and food.
Why, the very bell itself finds it too cold to
clank loudly. Well, well—duty is duty; some
say it’s a pleasure—humph! Hilloa, friend,
who are you? what do you want, man?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The traveller whom the porter thus addressed
was a tall, weather-beaten man, with long white
hair that fluttered from beneath his cap of furs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>and whose figure, naturally tall and robust,
seemed taller and larger from the vast cloak of
bearskins with which he was enveloped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am a merchant from a far country,” said
the man; “many wonderful things do I bring
to your emperor, if he will purchase of my
valuables.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, come in, come in, man,” said the porter;
“the king keeps high Christmas feast, and
on this night all men may seek his presence.
Wilt take some refreshment, good sir?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am never hungry, nor thirsty, nor cold.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m all,—there—straight before you, good
sir—the hall porter will usher you in—straight
before,” muttered the old porter, as he returned
to his fire and his supper. “Never hungry,
thirsty, nor cold—what a good poor man he
would make; humph! he loses many a pleasure,
though,” continued the porter, as he closed
the door of the lodge.</p>

<p class='c007'>The strange merchant presented himself to
the hall porter, and was ushered by him into
the presence of the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whom have we here?” said Domitian, as
the strange visitor made his obeisance. “What
seekest thou of me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I bring many things from far countries.
Wilt thou buy of my curiosities?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us see them,” rejoined Domitian.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>“I have three maxims of especial wisdom
and excellence, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us hear them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, my lord; if thou hearest them, and
likest not, then I have lost both my maxims
and my money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if I pay without hearing them, and
they are useless, I lose my time and my money.
What is the price?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A thousand florins, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A thousand florins for that of which I know
not what it is,” replied the king.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” rejoined the merchant, “if the
maxims do not stand you in good stead, I will
return the money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be it so then; let us hear your maxims.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The first, my lord, is on this wise: <span class='sc'>Never
begin any thing until you have calculated
what the end will be.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I like your maxim much,” said the king;
“let it be recorded in the chronicles of the kingdom,
inscribed on the walls and over the doors
of my palaces and halls of justice, and interwoven
on the borders of the linen of my table
and my chamber.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The second, my lord, is: <span class='sc'>Never leave a
highway for the bye-way.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see not the value of this maxim; but to
the third.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“<span class='sc'>Never sleep in the house where the
master is an old man and the wife a
young woman.</span> These three maxims, if attended
to, my lord, will stand you in good
stead.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We shall see,” said the king; “a year and
a day for the trial of each, at the end of this
time we will settle accounts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good master,” said the king’s jester, “wilt
sell thy chance of the thousand florins for my
fool’s cap?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait, and see what the end will be,” rejoined
the merchant; “a year and a day hence I will
return to see how my first maxim has fared.
Farewell, my lord....”</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c007'>The year and a day were nearly elapsed, and
yet the first maxim had not been clearly proved.
Domitian remained severely just, and the ill-intentioned
of his nobles plotted his destruction
in the hopes of indulging their vices more freely
under the rule of his successor. Many were the
plots they concocted to put him to death, but
all were foiled by his foresight and prudence.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Every failure,” said the conspirators at a
midnight meeting, “brings danger nearer to
ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even so, brothers, but this time we will not
fail,” said one of the number; “do ye not mind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>that I am the king’s barber; every day he bares
his throat to my razor, it is but one slash, and
we are free; promise me the crown: in return
for this, I will give you freedom by the king’s
death, and free license during my reign.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is well spoken,” cried all the conspirators;
“the barber shall be our king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the next morning, the barber entered the
chamber of Domitian, and prepared to shave
the king. The razor was stropped, the lather
spread upon the royal chin, and the towel
fastened round the royal breast. On the edge
of the napkin were these words in letters of
gold: “<i>Never begin any thing until you have
calculated what the end will be.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>The barber’s eye fell on these words, they
arrested his attention, he paused in his labors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What am I about to do?” thought he to
himself, “to kill the king, to gain his crown;
am I sure of the crown? shall I not rather be
slain miserably, and die amid unheard-of tortures
and infamy? whilst those that plot with
me will turn against me, and make me their
scape-goat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Art dreaming, sir barber?” exclaimed the
king.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the king’s voice, the barber trembled exceedingly,
he dropt the razor from his hand,
and fell at his sovereign’s feet.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“What means all this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my good lord!” exclaimed the barber,
as he knelt trembling at Domitian’s feet, “this
day was I to have killed thee; but I saw the
maxim written on the napkin; I thought of the
consequences, and now repent me of my wickedness.
Mercy, my good lord, mercy!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be faithful, and fear not,” replied the king.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The merchant, my lord the king,” said a
servant of the chamber, who entered at that
moment, followed by the old merchant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thou art come at a good time, sir merchant;
the first maxim has been proved; it has saved
my life; it was worthy of its price.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even as I expected, my lord; a year and a
day hence expect me again.”</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c007'>“We will trust no more to a single hand,”
said one of the conspirators, when they met
again after the barber’s repentance; “this time
we will all share.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I propose,” said one of the rebel lords, “an
ambush on the road to Naples. Every year, on
the day after Christmas, the king journeys
thither; the bye-path near to the city gates is
the nearest road, peradventure he will go that
way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Christmas night was over, the king
prepared to journey to Naples; a great company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>of nobles, knights, and men-at-arms, went with
him. Not far from the city, he came to the
place where the highway and bye-path diverged.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” said an old noble, “the day is
far spent, the sun sinks fast in the horizon;
will not my lord turn by the bye-path, as it is
far shorter than the high-road?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay,” said the king, “it’s a year and
a day since the merchant’s first maxim saved
my life; now will I test the second admonition,
‘<i>never leave a highway for a bye-path</i>,’ but go
part of ye by that path, and prepare for me
in the city; I and the rest will pursue the highway.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Onward rode the knights and the soldiers by
the bye-path, and hastened towards the city; as
they neared the ambush, the traitors sprang
upon them, for they thought the king was
among them. Every man slew his opponent,
and there remained not one of the king’s company,
to bear the tidings to the king, but a
youth, a little page whom the conspirators did
not remark during the attack.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the city gates, the king found the merchant
who had sold him his maxims.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Halt, O king!” said he, “the second
maxim has been proved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How so?” replied the king.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“The company that rode by the bye-path are
slain, every one of them save this little page,
who is here to tell the sad tale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is this so, good youth?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alas, my lord, it is too true; from behind
the trees they rushed upon our company as we
rode lightly and merrily, and no one, save your
poor page, lives to tell the tale.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For a second time is my life saved by thy
maxim; let it be inscribed in gold: ‘<span class='sc'>Never
leave a highway for a bye-way.</span>’”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For a year and a day, O king, fare thee
well.”</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c007'>“A murrain on the old fool’s maxims,” grumbled
the chief of the conspirators, when they
discovered that the king had escaped their
design; “we are beaten out of every plot, and
had best submit to his dominion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay,” exclaimed a young and licentious
noble, “there is luck in odd numbers, let us
have one more trial, a sink or a swim.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I care not if we try once more,” said the
old rebel; “but come, who suggests a scheme?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I, and I, and I!” exclaimed several at
once; but their schemes were pronounced
futile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What say ye to this?” said the young man
who had spoken before: “every year the king
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>goes to the small village town where his old
nurse lives; there is but one house in the village
where he can be lodged, let us bribe the master
of the house, that he slay our tyrant while he
sleeps.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The plan was approved by the rebel lords,
the bribe offered and accepted by the old man,
to whose house the king always came. The
king came as usual to the village town, and to
his old lodgings. As he entered, the old man
received him with humility and feigned delight,
and a young damsel, not eighteen years of age,
attended at the door step. The king noticed
the damsel, he arrested his steps, and called to
the old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good father,” asked he, “is yonder damsel
thy daughter or thy niece?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither, my lord,” replied the old man;
“she is my newly married wife.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Away, away,” said the king to his chamberlain,
“prepare me a bed in another house, for I
will not sleep here to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even as my lord wishes,” rejoined the
chamberlain; “but my lord knows there is no
other house in this place fit for a king’s residence,
save this one; here every thing is prepared,
every thing commodious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have spoken,” replied the king; “remain
thou here; I will sleep elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>In the night, the old man and his wife arose,
stole on tiptoe to the chamber which was prepared
for the king, and where the chamberlain
now slept in the royal bed; all was dark as they
approached the bed, and plunged a dagger into
the breast of the sleeping noble.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is done,” said they; “to bed, to bed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Early the next morning the king’s page
knocked at the door of the humble abode
where the king had passed the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why so early, good page?” asked the
king.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord, the old merchant waits thy rising;
and even now strange news is come from the
village.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let the merchant and the messenger come
in.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The merchant seemed greatly elated, his eye
glistened with joy, and his figure appeared dilated
beyond its ordinary height. The messenger
was pale and trembling, and staring aghast
with fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord, my good lord,” exclaimed the pallid
messenger, “a horrible murder has been
committed on your chamberlain; he lies dead
in the royal bed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The third maxim is tried and proved,” said
the merchant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give God the praise,” said the king; “thy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>reward is earned: a robe of honor, and thrice
thy bargained price; to the old man and his
wife, immediate death.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“What theological application does the author append
to this clever tale?” said Herbert, “for moral it
wants not, as it tells its own.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The emperor is any good Christian; the porter, none
other than <i>free will;</i> whilst the merchant represents our
blessed Saviour. The florins are virtues, given in exchange
for the maxims; the grace and favor of God.
The conspirators are devils; the highway is the Ten
Commandments; the bye-way, a bad life; the rebels in
ambush, heretics.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“So far as it goes, I do not object to the explanation;
it requires great additions, however,” replied Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Which the author considered to be compensated for
by adding more characters than the tale contained, in
several of his other explanations.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Domitian is obliged to the old monk,” said Thompson,
“for such a pretty character of justice and mercy.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“See again the system of compensation; in the next
story Adrian is as much traduced, as Domitian flattered
in this. But, remember, the old monk was writing
neither histories nor biographies; any name that occurred
to him served his purpose; he looks more to the
effect of his incidents than to the names of his characters.
With this prelude I will give you</p>

<h3 class='c013'>“THE TRIALS OF EUSTACE.”</h3>

<p class='c014'>When Trajan was emperor of Rome, Sir
Placidus, a knight of great prowess, and
a most skilful commander, was chief of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>armies of the empire. Like his imperial master,
he was merciful, just, and charitable, but a
worshipper of idols, a despiser of the Christian
faith. His wife was worthy of his virtues, and
was of one accord with him in his religion.
Two sons had he, educated in all the magnificence
that befitted their father’s station; but, as
was to be expected, the faith of the parents was
the faith of their children; they were idolaters.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a fair, soft day, the southerly wind
blew lightly over the meadows, and the fleecy
clouds, ever and anon obscuring the sun, proclaimed
the hunters’ day. Sir Placidus rode to
the chase. His friends and his retainers were
with him, and a right gallant company were
they. A herd of deer was soon found, the dogs
loosed from their leashes, the bugles sounded,
and the whole of the company in full and eager
pursuit. One stag of lofty stature, and many-branching
antlered head, separated itself from
the rest of the herd, and made for the depths of
the neighboring forest. The company followed
the herd, but Sir Placidus gave his attention to
the noble animal, and tracked it through the
mazes of the wood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Swift and long was the chase. Sir Placidus rode
after the stag, ever gaining just near enough to
the noble animal to inspire him with a hope of its
ultimate capture, yet never so near as to strike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>it with his hunting spear. On, on they went
with untiring speed. The wood and its thickets
were passed, a lofty hill rose to the view. He
pressed the stag up its sides, and gained rapidly
on the chase. In a moment the stag turned and
faced the knight; he prepared to strike, but his
hand was stayed as he saw between the horns of
the creature a cross encircled with a ring of
glorious light. Whilst he mused on the wonder,
a voice addressed him. The stag seemed to
speak thus to the knight:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why persecutest thou me, Placidus? for thy
sake have I assumed this shape; I am the God
whom thou ignorantly worshippest; I am Christ.
Thine alms and thy prayers have gone up before me,
and therefore am I now come. As thou
dost hunt this stag; even so will I hunt thee.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Placidus swooned at these words, and fell from
his horse. How long he lay on the ground he
knew not. When his senses returned, he cried
in anguish:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me thy will, O Lord, that I may believe
in thee, and perform it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then replied the voice: “I am Christ, the
son of the living God. I created heaven and
earth, caused the light to arise, and divided it
from the darkness. I appointed days, and seasons,
and years. I formed man out of the dust
of the earth, and for his sake took upon me his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>form. Crucified, and buried, on the third day I
arose again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All this I believe, Lord,” replied Placidus;
“yea, and that thou art he who bringest back
the wandering sinner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then said the voice: “If thou believest, go
into the city and be baptized.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shall I reveal this unto my wife and children,
Lord, that they also may believe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yea,” replied the voice; “return here on
the morrow’s dawn, that thou mayest know of
thy future life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Placidus returned to his wife, and told her all
that had happened unto him; then did they believe,
and were baptized, and their children with
them. The knight was called Eustace, his wife
Theosbyta, whilst to his two sons the names of
Theosbytus and Agapetus were given in their
baptism. On the morrow, the knight returned
to the place where he had seen the vision.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I implore thee, O Lord, to manifest thyself
according to thy word,” prayed the knight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the voice was heard, saying: “Blessed
art thou, Eustace, in that thou hast been washed
with the laver of my grace, and thereby overcome
the Devil. Now hast thou trodden him to
dust, who beguiled thee. Now will thy fidelity
be shown; for he whom thou hast forsaken will
rage continually against thee. Many things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>must thou undergo for my sake. Thou must become
another Job; fear not; persevere; my grace
is sufficient for thee. In the end thou shalt conquer;
choose then, whether thou wilt experience
thy trials in thine old age, or forthwith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even as thou willest, O Lord; yet, if it may
be so, try me now, and help me in my trial.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be bold, Eustace; my grace can support
you.” With these words, the voice died away,
and was no more heard; and Eustace, after
prayer and praise to God, rose from his knees,
and returned to his own house.</p>

<p class='c007'>But a few days had elapsed, ere the trials of
Job came upon Eustace and his family; pestilence
carried off his flocks and his herds, and
his servants fled away, or died with their charges.
Robbers plundered his palace, driving away the
knight, his wife, and his sons, in poverty and
nakedness. It was in vain that the emperor
sought everywhere for the knight, for not the
slightest trace of him could be found.</p>

<p class='c007'>At length the unhappy fugitives, covered with
such rags as they could obtain, reached the sea-shore,
and besought a passage across the waters.
The captain of the vessel was captivated with
the beauty of Theosbyta, and consented to carry
them over. No sooner were they on the further
side, than he demanded of them money for their
voyage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“Good master,” said Eustace, “I am poor
and destitute, and have no money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” replied the captain; “thy wife
will do as well; I take her as my slave; she
will sell for the passage money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“With my life only will I part with her,” exclaimed
the knight, as his wife clung to him in
her distress.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As you please, master; ho, men! seize the
woman, and take her to my cabin; as for the
man and his brats, heave them overboard.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Leave me, leave me, Eustace,” murmured
Theosbyta; “save thyself and our children; I
can but die once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With many a hard struggle, Eustace consented;
he clasped his two boys by their hands,
and led them from the ship.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, my poor children!” he cried; “your
poor mother is lost; in a strange land and in
the power of a strange lord must she lament
her fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A few hours’ travelling brought Eustace and
his children to the bank of a broad and rapid
river, the water of which ran so deep, that he
feared to cross its stream with both his boys at
one time; placing one therefore on the bank,
under the shade of a bush, he clasped the eldest
in his arms and plunged into the river. The
stream ran swiftly, and the bottom was treacherous;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>but at length he reached the further
side, and placed Theosbytus on the bank.
Again he plunged into the river. The middle
of the stream was but fairly gained, when he
saw a wolf creep from the wood close to
which his younger son was placed, and approach
the child. It was all in vain that he
shouted, and strove to reach the shore; the
wolf seized the child and bore it off, before its
father’s eyes. At that moment a loud roar
from the other bank startled the bereaved
father; he turned, and saw a lion carrying
away his eldest son.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alas, alas!” exclaimed Eustace, as soon as
he had reached the further bank of the river.
“Once was I flourishing like a luxuriant tree,
but now I am altogether blighted. Military ensigns
were around me, and bands of armed men.
Now I am alone in the world. My wife, my
children are taken from me; the one to slavery,
the others to death. O Lord, thou didst warn
me that I must endure the perils of Job, are not
these worse than that holy man’s? In his
greatest misery he had a couch whereon to rest
his wearied limbs, and friends to compassionate
him in his misfortunes. His wife, too, remained
to him—mine is gone from me: place a bridle
on my lips, lest I utter foolishness, and stand
up against thee, O my God.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>His heart relieved by these passionate expressions,
the knight continued his travel; after
many days of want and fatigue, he reached a
far-off village, where he abode with one of the
villagers as his hired servant. For fifteen years
he served his master faithfully, and at his death
he succeeded to his cottage and his land.</p>

<p class='c007'>Trajan still lived, but his fortunes did not
prosper; his enemies became daily stronger
and stronger, for Placidus no longer directed
the movements of the imperial army, or urged
on the soldiers, by his example, to deeds of
valor against the enemy. Often and often did
the emperor think of his lost commander, and
ceaseless were his endeavors to discover the
place of his concealment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eustace was working in his fields about this
time, little thinking of Trajan, or of Rome,
when two men drew near, and after observing
him for some time, and communing with each
other, accosted the knight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friend,” said one of the men, “dost know
in these parts a knight named Placidus and his
two sons?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The heart of Eustace was sore tried, when he
saw the emissaries of Trajan. The sight of
them recalled his previous honors in the world,
and he still felt a lingering wish to retrace his
steps. “Nay,” he thought, “were I not alone,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>it were well to return; but for a solitary,
this place is best.” Then said he to the two
men:</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no one about here, good sirs, of the
name you ask after.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is but a fool’s errand we are on, master, I
fear,” said the man; “we have travelled far
and near after our old general, but no one
knows aught of him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is years since he left Rome, friends, is it
not?” rejoined Eustace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fifteen years and more; but come, comrade,
we must go onwards.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, sirs, come to my poor abode; what I
have is at your service.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The emissaries of Trajan gladly acceded to
Eustace’s request. The homely repast was
soon placed on the board, and the men sat down
to refresh themselves, while Eustace waited
upon them. Again the thoughts of his old
home came thickly upon him, and he could not
restrain his tears. He left the room where his
guests were, bathed his face with water, and
returned to wait on the two men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have a strange presentiment,” remarked
one of the men during Eustace’s absence, “that
our good host is even he whom we search after.
Marked you not how he hesitated when we first
addressed him?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>“Ay, and even now he has left us with his
eyes red with suppressed tears.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let us try the last test, the sabre mark on
his head, which he received in the passage of the
Danube, when he struck down the northern
champion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as Eustace returned the soldiers examined
his head, and finding the wished-for
mark, embraced their old general; the neighbors,
too, came in, and the exploits of Eustace
were soon in the mouths of the villagers.</p>

<p class='c007'>For fifteen days they journeyed towards Rome,
Eustace and his two guides; as they neared the
imperial capital, the emperor came out to meet
his old commander. Eustace would have fallen
at his master’s feet, but Trajan forbade him;
and side by side, amid the congratulations and
applauses of the people, the emperor and his
long-lost servant entered Rome.</p>

<p class='c007'>The return of Eustace inspired the people with
confidence; thousands hurried from every village
to volunteer as soldiers, and his only difficulty
was to select who should be rejected. One
contingent from a far-off village arrested his
attention; it was headed by two youths of wonderful
likeness the one to the other, and apparently
within a year of the same age. They were
tall in stature, of commanding features, and
their selection as leaders, by their comrades, did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>justice to their attainments and the superiority
of their manners. Pleased with the youths,
Eustace placed them in the van of his army, and
began his march against the invaders, who had
reached within a few miles of the coast whereon
he had disembarked from the ship of the barbarous
captain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pitching his camp within sight of that of the
enemy, the commander billeted the best of his
troops in a small village that formed the rear of
his position. A widow lady, of but few years,
but sorely worn with grief, received the two
youths into her house. About the mid-day meal,
the youths conversed the one with the other of
their early life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of what I was when a child,” said the elder,
“I know only this, that my father carried me
over a broad river, and laid me under a bush
whilst he returned to fetch my brother; but
whilst he was gone a lion came, seized me by
the clothes, and bore me into a wood hard by.
My mother we lost on our journey nigh to a
great sea, where she remained with a cruel captain
who had seized her for his slave. As I was
carried away by the lion, methought a wolf
seized on my brother, whom my father had left
on the other bank. The lion soon dropped me,
for men with loud cries and stones pursued him
and drove him from me. Then did they take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>me to the village where we have lived together
so long.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My brother, O my brother!” exclaimed the
other youth, hardly able to restrain his emotions
during the recital, “I am he whom the
wolf carried off, saved from his jaws by the
shepherds, as thou wast from the jaws of the
lion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The widow had listened to the wonderful story
of the two young men. Much she marvelled at
their preservation; on the morrow she sought the
commander of the imperial forces; she found
him in his tent; his officers were around him,
and the two young men stood within the circle.
The widow craved permission to return to her
own country.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sir,” she said, “I am a stranger in these
parts; fifteen years have passed since I left
Rome with my husband, once high in power,
and rich, but then poor and in misery; we
reached yonder sea, our two sons were with us,
we crossed in a shipman’s boat, but when we
arrived on this side he demanded money of my
husband, and when he had it not to give him
he seized on me and carried me into slavery.
Years lived I beneath his roof in sorrow and in
pain; but it was in vain that he sought to do
me evil, for God preserved me from his devices.
At length my master died, and I became free;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>since then I have labored honestly, and would
now return to Rome, if, perchance, I may find
my husband and my children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Theosbyta!” said the general, in a low
voice, raising his helmet as he spoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Eustace! my husband!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The general raised his fainting wife, and
kissed her gently on her forehead. “Our sons,
Theosbyta, we shall see no more; a lion and a
wolf carried them off before mine eyes, as we
crossed the river not many leagues from hence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Father! our father!” said the two youths,
as they knelt before the general.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, doubt not, Eustace,” said his wife,
“last night I overheard the tale of their adventures;
this is he whom the lion took; this one did
the shepherds rescue from the jaws of the wolf.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tale was soon retold, and Eustace convinced
that he had recovered in one day his
wife and his sons. Then loud blew the trumpets
through the camp, and cheer upon cheer rang
from the good soldiers, when their general came
from his tent, leading his long-lost wife, and
supported on either side by his sons. The enthusiasm
aided them in obtaining the victory
over the enemy. Every one loved their general,
and rejoiced in his joy; and that day they
fought for their home, their emperor, and their
commander.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Trajan lived not to welcome home his honored
general; his successor, however, spared not to
receive Eustace with the honors his achievements
deserved. The banquet-hall was gorgeous
with ornaments; and the banquet replete with
delicacies and curiosities. On the emperor’s
right hand sat Eustace, and his sons occupied
no mean place in the banquet-hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To-morrow,” said the emperor, “we will
sacrifice to the great gods of war, and offer our
thanks for this thy victory.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As my lord pleases,” said Eustace; “one
thing I pray, that my lord will not regard my
absence from the temple as an intentional
slight on his royal person.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Absence, sir!” exclaimed the emperor; “I
command your attendance; see that you and
yours are before the altar of Mars at noon to-morrow;
thou shalt offer there with thine own
hands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will cut off the hand that so offends,” replied
Eustace.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! a Christian—be it so—sacrifice or die!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Death then, my lord; I worship Christ, not
idols.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let him save thee from the lions’ mouths,”
exclaimed the impious emperor. “Ho, guards!
this Christian and his sons to the beasts’ den;
come, my guests, to the arena.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“And me to my lord,” said Theosbyta, advancing
from the lower part of the hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As thou wilt: come, sirs; our lions will be
well fed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The party reached the amphitheatre; it was
crowded with spectators. Rumor had soon
carried abroad the tidings that the triumphant
general was to die by the lion’s mouth, for his
Christianity. Some pitied him for what they
called his folly: “What, die for a little incense
thrown on the fire!” Others gloried in his expected
death, for they hated the new faith. A
few in secret prayed to God, to give their
brother strength to undergo his fearful martyrdom,
for they were Christians.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eustace stood in the arena; his wife knelt by
his side, his sons stood before him to meet the
lion’s first bound. The crowd grew impatient—a
sudden silence; a sound as of revolving hinges,
and then a sullen roar, as with a bound the
lion sprang into the centre of the amphitheatre.
One look he cast on the youths; and then he
bowed his head, crept to their feet and licked
them; another, and another, was let loose; but
the old lion kept guard over the family, and
fought with the other lions, and drove them
back to their dens.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is enough,” said the emperor, “he has
a charm against the teeth of beasts; we will test
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>his powers against the heat of fire; prepare the
brazen ox.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A fire was lighted beneath the animal, a vast
hollow frame that represented an ox, and into
the belly of which the victims were introduced
through a door in the right side. As soon as it
was heated to its utmost heat, the executioners
hastened to throw their victims in; Eustace
forbade them, and then clasping his wife in his
arms, and followed by his sons, he moved
slowly up the ladder that led to the horrid cell,
and entered the belly of the brazen ox calmly
and without fear.</p>

<p class='c007'>For three days the fire was kept burning beneath
the creature. On the third evening the
beast was opened; within lay Eustace, his wife,
and his sons, as it were in a deep and placid
sleep. Not a hair of their heads was burnt, nor
was the smell of fire upon their persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>So died they all: the father, the wife, and the
children. The people buried them with honor,
and remembered with sorrow the martyrdom of
the Christian general.</p>

<p class='c015'>“The scene of the conversion,” said Thompson, “recalls
to my mind Doddridge’s account of Colonel Gardiner,
converted from his licentious life by an almost similar
vision of our Saviour on the cross, and by an address
not less effective than the words heard by the Eustace of
your tale.”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“Few of my old monk’s tales are more true, in their
leading features,” said Herbert, “than this of the trials
of Eustace and his family. It has been told more than
once as an authentic history, and you will find it alluded
to in Butler’s ‘Lives of the Saints,’ where it is stated
that a church at Rome was dedicated to the memory of
St. Eustachius.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Surely the incident of the stag and the cross is very
similar to that in the legend of St. Herbert.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Almost identical, Thompson,” rejoined Herbert; “in
the foreign pictures the two incidents are generally depicted
in nearly the same manner.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Another curious similarity occurs in the early English
romance of Sir Isumbras,” said Lathom. “That
knight’s misfortunes came upon him in a very similar
manner to poor Eustace’s: the knight, his wife, and his
three children wander on their pilgrimage to the Holy
Land; she wrapped in his surcoat, his scarlet mantle being
divided among his three children. They so reach
a river, and two of their children are carried off by a
lion and a leopard ; one child, however, and the mother
are left: then sings the old poet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Through the forest they went days three,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till they came to the Greekish sea;</div>
      <div class='line in6'>They grieved and were full wo!</div>
      <div class='line'>As they stood upon the land</div>
      <div class='line'>They saw a fleet come sailand (<i>sailing</i>),</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Three hundred ships and mo. (<i>more</i>),</div>
      <div class='line'>With top castles set on loft,</div>
      <div class='line'>Richly then were they wrought,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>With joy and mickle pride:</div>
      <div class='line'>A heathen king was therein,</div>
      <div class='line'>That Christendom came to win,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>His power was full wide.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“The king, of course, plays the part of the cruel ship-captain,”
said Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes. Seven days’ hunger drives the knight and his
lady to the sultan’s galley, to ask for bread: taken for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>spies, they are at first driven off, until the noble stature
of the knight, and the fair complexion of the wife,
‘bright as a blossom on a tree,’ convince the Saracens
that their piteous tale is true. To the knight the sultan
offers rank, honors, and wealth, if he will renounce
Christianity and fight under the Moslem banners. Sir
Isumbras refuses, and renews his petition for bread.
Then, continues the poet,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘The sultan beheld that lady there,</div>
      <div class='line'>Him thought an angel that she were,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Comen a-down from heaven:</div>
      <div class='line'>Man—I will give thee gold and fee,</div>
      <div class='line'>An thou that woman will sellen me,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>More than thou can <i>never</i> (name).</div>
      <div class='line'>I will give thee a hundred pounds</div>
      <div class='line'>Of pennies that be whole and round,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>And rich robes seven.</div>
      <div class='line'>She shall be queen of my land;</div>
      <div class='line'>And all men bow unto her hand;</div>
      <div class='line in6'>And none withstand her steven (voice).</div>
      <div class='line'>Sir Isumbras said—Nay;</div>
      <div class='line'>My wife I will not sell away,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Though ye me for her sloo (slew).</div>
      <div class='line'>I wedded her in goddis lay</div>
      <div class='line'>To hold her to my ending day,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Both for weal and wo.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“A decided refusal to complete the bargain,” said
Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yet not so taken by the sultan; the money is counted
into the knight’s cloak, the lady taken forcible possession
of, and Sir Isumbras and his child carried on shore, and
beat until hardly able to move, but here we must stop
with the early English romance, having already gone
beyond its similarity to the old monk’s story. And now
I must break off for to-night; I know it is but a short
allowance, and shall be compensated for when we next meet.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“Your stories about sorcerers and sorcery, Lathom,”
said Herbert, “have made me consider a little as to
the amount of truth on which such fictions may have
been founded.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Perhaps you believe in witches, magicians, and all
that tribe, that gather deadly herbs by moonlight, and
ride through the air on broomsticks,” said Thompson,
with a smile.</p>

<p class='c012'>“May not Herbert fairly ask you,” said Lathom,
“whether there is any antecedent improbability in mortal
beings obtaining, from the spirit of evil, a temporary
superhuman power; or in the idea of Satan awarding
the riches and honors of this world to those who will fall
down and worship him?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Selden’s apology for the law against witches in his
time shows a lurking belief,” remarked Herbert. “‘If,’
says that sour old lawyer, ‘one man believes that by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>turning his hat thrice and crying “buz,” he could take
away a fellow-creature’s life, this were a just law made
by the state, that whosoever should do so, should forfeit
his life.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“He must have believed, or his logical mind would
have seen, that a law waging war with intentions which
are incapable of fulfilment, is both wrong and mischievous.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” said Herbert, “as good a lawyer as Selden
and a better man, did not fear to profess his belief in
witchcraft, and to give his judicial countenance to trials
for sorcery:—Sir Matthew Hale was ever ready to admit
his belief in witches and witchcraft.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To the lawyers you may add the learned antiquary
and physician, Sir Thomas Brown, the author of the
‘Religio Medici.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But surely, Lathom, all this belief, as well as the
practice of witch-tormenting, ceased about 1682,” said
Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The belief in witchcraft has never yet been extinct,
and the practice of witch-burning lasted forty years after
that, at least in Scotland. The act of James, so minutely
describing witches and their acts, and so strenuously inciting
the people to burn them, remained on the statute-book
until the ninth year of George the Second; and as
late as 1722 the hereditary sheriff of Sutherlandshire
condemned a poor woman to death as a witch.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I believe I can carry down the belief at least a few
years later than the date even of the last witch execution,”
remarked Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Among the poor and uneducated, undoubtedly?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, Thompson, with them it remains even now; I
speak not only of the educated, but of that class of men
which is most conversant with evidence, and most addicted
to discredit fictitious stories.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What, the lawyers?”</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>“Even so,” replied Lathom; “in 1730, William Forbes,
in his ‘Institutes of the Law of Scotland,’ published in
that year, makes this remark: ‘Nothing seems plainer to
me, than that there have been witches, and that, perhaps,
such are now actually existing; which I intend,
God willing, to clear in a larger work concerning the
criminal law.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Did this large work appear?” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“I should think not; at least, it is not known.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The old Jesuit from whom you got your version of
The Ungrateful Man, has a story illustrative of a kind of
witchcraft that all will admit to have been very prevalent
in every age,” said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What, will you believe in witchcraft in any form?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“At all events, in one form—the witchcraft of love;
my instance is the story of Semiramis and Ninus. I will
read it you from the same version that Lathom used for
his tale of Vitalis and Massaccio.”</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>THE QUEEN SEMIRAMIS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>“Of all my wives,” said King Ninus to Semiramis,
“it is you I love the best.
None have charms and graces like you, and for
you I would willingly resign them all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let the king consider well what he says,”
replied Semiramis. “What if I were to take
him at his word?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do so,” returned the monarch; “whilst beloved
by you, I am indifferent to all others.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So, then, if I asked it,” said Semiramis,
“you would banish all your other wives, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>love me alone? I should be alone your consort,
the partaker of your power, and queen of
Assyria?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Queen of Assyria! Are you not so already,”
said Ninus, “since you reign, by your beauty,
over its king?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No—no,” answered his lovely mistress; “I
am at present only a slave whom you love. I
reign not; I merely charm. When I give an
order, you are consulted before I am obeyed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And to reign, then, you think so great a
pleasure?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, to one who has never experienced it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And do you wish, then, to experience it?
Would you like to reign a few days in my
place?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take care, O king! do not offer too much.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I repeat it,” said the captivated monarch.
“Would you like, for one whole day, to
be sovereign mistress of Assyria? If you would,
I consent to it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And all which I command, then, shall be
executed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I will resign to you, for one entire day,
my power and my golden sceptre.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And when shall this be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To-morrow if you like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I do,” said Semiramis; and let her head fall
upon the shoulder of the king, like a beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>woman asking pardon for some caprice which
has been yielded to.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next morning, Semiramis called her women,
and commanded them to dress her magnificently.
On her head she wore a crown of
precious stones, and appeared thus before Ninus.
Ninus, enchanted with her beauty, ordered the
officers of the palace to assemble in the state
chamber, and his golden sceptre to be brought
from the treasury. He then entered the chamber,
leading Semiramis by the hand. All prostrated
themselves before the aspect of the king,
who conducted Semiramis to the throne, and
seated her upon it. Then ordering the whole
assembly to rise, he announced to the court that
they were to obey, during the whole day, Semiramis
as himself. So saying, he took up the
golden sceptre, and placing it in the hands of
Semiramis—“Queen,” said he, “I commit to
you the emblem of sovereign power; take it,
and command with sovereign authority. All
here are your slaves, and I myself am nothing
more than your servant for the whole of this
day. Whoever shall be remiss in executing
your orders, let him be punished as if he had
disobeyed the commands of the king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Having thus spoken, the king knelt down before
Semiramis, who gave him, with a smile,
her hand to kiss. The courtiers then passed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>succession, each making oath to execute
blindly the orders of Semiramis. When the
ceremony was finished, the king made her his
compliments, and asked her how she had managed
to go through it with so grave and majestical
an air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whilst they were promising to obey me,”
said Semiramis, “I was thinking what I should
command each of them to do. I have but one
day of power, and I will employ it well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king laughed at this reply. Semiramis
appeared more <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">piquante</span></i> and amiable than ever.
“Let us see,” said he, “how you will continue
your part. By what orders will you begin?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let the secretary of the king approach my
throne,” said Semiramis, in a loud voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The secretary approached; two slaves placed
a little table before him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Write,” said Semiramis: “‘Under penalty
of death, the governor of the citadel of Babylon
is ordered to yield up the command of the citadel
to him who shall bear to him this order.’
Fold this order, seal it with the king’s seal, and
give it to me. Write now: ‘Under penalty of
death, the governor of the slaves of the palace
is ordered to resign the command of the slaves
into the hands of the person who shall present
to him this order.’ Fold, seal it with the king’s
seal, and deliver to me this decree. Write
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>again: ‘Under penalty of death, the general of
the army encamped under the walls of Babylon
is ordered to resign the command of the army
to him who shall be the bearer of this order.’
Fold, seal, and deliver to me this decree.”</p>

<p class='c007'>She took the three orders, thus dictated, and
put them in her bosom. The whole court was
struck with consternation; the king himself
was surprised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Listen,” said Semiramis. “In two hours
hence let all the officers of the state come and
offer me presents, as is the custom on the accession
of new princes, and let a festival be prepared
for this evening. Now, let all depart. Let my
faithful servant Ninus alone remain. I have
to consult him upon affairs of state.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When all the rest had gone out—“You see,”
said Semiramis, “that I know how to play
the queen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ninus laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My beautiful queen,” said he, “you play
your part with astonishment. But, if your servant
may dare question you, what would you
do with the orders you have dictated?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should be no longer queen were I obliged
to give an account of my actions. Nevertheless,
this was my motive. I have a vengeance to execute
against the three officers whom these
orders menace.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“Vengeance—and wherefore?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The first, the governor of the citadel, is one-eyed,
and frightens me every time I meet him;
the second, the chief of the slaves, I hate, because
he threatens me with rivals; the third,
the general of the army, deprives me too often
of your company,—you are constantly in the
camp.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This reply, in which caprice and flattery were
mingled, enchanted Ninus. “Good,” said he,
laughing. “Here are the three first officers of
the empire dismissed for very sufficient reasons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The gentlemen of the court now came to
present their gifts to the queen. Some gave
precious stones; others, of a lower rank, flowers
and fruits; and the slaves, having nothing to
give, gave nothing but homage. Among these
last, there were three young brothers, who had
come from the Caucasus with Semiramis, and
had rescued the caravan in which the women
were, from an enormous tiger. When they
passed before the throne—</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you,” said she to the three brothers,
“have you no present to make to your queen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No other,” replied the first, Zopire, “than
my life to defend her.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“None other,” replied the second, Artaban,
“than my sabre against her enemies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“None other,” replied the third, Assar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“than the respect and admiration which her
presence inspires.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Slaves,” said Semiramis, “it is you who have
made me the most valuable present of the whole
court, and I will not be ungrateful. You who
have offered me your sword against my enemies,
take this order, carry it to the general of the
army encamped under the walls of Babylon,
give it to him, and see what he will do for you.
You who have offered me your life for my defence,
take this order to the governor of the citadel,
and see what he will do for you; and you who
offer me the respect and admiration which my
presence inspires, take this order, give it to the
commandant of the slaves of the palace, and see
what will be the result.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Never had Semiramis displayed so much
gayety, so much folly, and so much grace, and
never was Ninus so captivated. Nor were her
charms lessened in his eyes, when a slave not
having executed promptly an insignificant
order, she commanded his head to be struck off,
which was immediately done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without bestowing a thought on this trivial
matter, Ninus continued to converse with Semiramis
till the evening and the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> arrived. When
she entered the saloon which had been prepared
for the occasion, a slave brought her a plate, in
which was the head of the decapitated eunuch.—“’Tis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>well,” said she, after having examined
it. “Place it on a stake in the court of the
palace, that all may see it, and be you there on
the spot to proclaim to every one, that the man
to whom this head belonged lived three hours
ago, but that having disobeyed my will, his
head was separated from his body.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> was magnificent; a sumptuous banquet
was prepared in the gardens, and Semiramis
received the homage of all with a grace and
majesty perfectly regal; she continually turned
to and conversed with Ninus, rendering him the
most distinguished honor. “You are,” said
she, “a foreign king, come to visit me in my
palace. I must make your visit agreeable to
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly after the banquet was served, Semiramis
confounded and reversed all ranks. Ninus
was placed at the bottom of the table. He was
the first to laugh at this caprice; and the court,
following his example, allowed themselves to be
placed, without murmuring, according to the
will of the queen. She seated near herself the
three brothers from the Caucasus.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are my orders executed?” she demanded of
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” replied they.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> was very gay. A slave having, by the
force of habit, served the king first, Semiramis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>had him beaten with rods. His cries mingled
with the laughter of the guests. Every one was
inclined to merriment. It was a comedy, in
which each played his part. Towards the end
of the repast, when wine had added to the general
gayety, Semiramis rose from her elevated
seat, and said: “My lords, the treasurer of the
empire has read me a list of those who this
morning have brought me their gifts of congratulation
on my joyful accession to the throne.
One grandee alone of the court has failed to
bring his gift.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is it?” cried Ninus. “He must be
punished severely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is yourself, my lord—you who speak; what
have you given to the queen this morning?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ninus rose, and came with a smiling countenance
to whisper something into the ear of the
queen. “The queen is insulted by her servant!”
exclaimed Semiramis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I embrace your knees to obtain my pardon,
beautiful queen,” said he; “pardon me, pardon
me”; and he added in a lower tone, “I wish
this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</span></i> were finished.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You wish, then, that I should abdicate?”
said Semiramis. “But no—I have still two
hours to reign”; and at the same time she withdrew
her hand, which the king was covering
with kisses. “I pardon not,” said she, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>loud voice, “such an insult on the part of a
slave. Slave, prepare thyself to die.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Silly child that thou art,” said Ninus, still
on his knees, “yet will I give way to thy folly;
but patience, thy reign will soon be over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You will not then be angry,” said she, in a
whisper, “at some thing I am going to order at
this moment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” said he.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Slaves!” said she aloud, “seize this man—seize
this Ninus!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ninus, smiling, put himself into the hands of
the slaves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take him out of the saloon, lead him into
the court of the seraglio, prepare every thing
for his death, and wait my orders.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The slaves obeyed, and Ninus followed them,
laughing, into the court of the seraglio. They
passed by the head of the disobeying eunuch.
Then Semiramis placed herself on a balcony.
Ninus had suffered his hands to be tied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hasten,” said the queen, “hasten, Zopire,
to the fortress; you to the camp, Artaban;
Assar, do you secure all the gates of the palace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The orders were given in a whisper, and executed
immediately.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Beautiful queen,” said Ninus, laughing,
“this comedy wants but its conclusion; pray,
let it be a prompt one.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>“I will,” said Semiramis. “Slaves, recollect
the eunuch. Strike!”</p>

<p class='c007'>They struck; Ninus had hardly time to utter
a cry; when his head fell upon the pavement,
the smile was still upon his lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, I am queen of Assyria,” exclaimed
Semiramis; “and perish every one, like the
eunuch and Ninus, who dare disobey my
orders.”</p>

<p class='c015'>“The discovery of the sword by Sir Guido, in your tale
of the Crusader,” said Herbert, “reminds me of the elfin
swords so common among the Scandinavian heroes.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Such as the enchanted sword taken by a pirate from
the tomb of a Norwegian monarch,” suggested Lathom.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Rather, perhaps, of those manufactured by the elves
under compulsion, or from gratitude to some earthly
warrior; the famous sword <i>Tyrfing</i>, the weapon of the
Scandinavian monarch Suafurlami, was one of these.
This is the story as given by Scott, in the second volume
of his Scottish Minstrelsy: ‘The Scandinavian king, returning
from hunting, bewildered himself among the
mountains; about sunset he beheld a large rock, and
two dwarfs sitting before the mouth of a cavern. The
king drew his sword, and intercepted their retreat by
springing between them and their recess, and imposed
upon them the following condition of safety:—That they
should make him a falchion, with a baldric and scabbard
of pure gold, and a blade which would divide stones and
iron as a garment, and which would render the wielder
of it ever victorious in battle. The elves complied with
his demand, and Suafurlami pursued his way home.
Returning at the time appointed, the dwarfs delivered to
him the famous sword <i>Tyrfing</i>; then standing in the entrance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>to the cavern, spoke thus: “This sword, O king,
shall destroy a man every time it is brandished; but it
shall perform three atrocious deeds, and shall be thy
bane.” The king rushed forward with the charmed
sword, and buried both its edges in the rock, but the
dwarfs escaped into their recesses. This enchanted
sword emitted rays like the sun, dazzling all against
whom it was brandished; it divided steel like water, and
was never unsheathed without slaying a man.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The supernatural skill in the fabrication of arms
attributed to the Northern elves,” remarked Lathom,
“seems to indicate some traces of historical truth. The
Fins, who inhabited Scandinavia when Odin and his
Asiatics invaded the country, retired to the mountains
to avoid the tyranny of the new people. Far
better acquainted than the invaders could have been
with the mines of their country, a superior knowledge
in the manufacture of arms may be fairly awarded
to them. And thus, in time, the oppressed Fins would
come to be the dwarfish armorers of Scandinavian mythology.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As theory is the fashion,” said Thompson, “what
say you to a geological foundation to many of your mythological
wonders? Were not the great dragons of stone
suddenly released from their rocky beds—the long serpents
guarding treasures in deep pits—the closely coiled
snake of the cavern—were not many of these the gigantic
antediluvian relics of our caves? Has not many an
ichthyosaurus, in his earthly bed, been transformed into
a deputy fiend, or even into the father of evil himself,
keeping watch over some hoard of ill-gotten wealth;
whilst the strange form of the huge pterodactyl, with
its wings and claws, has been metamorphosed into the
dragon of Wantley and his compeers?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Your theory, Thompson,” rejoined Herbert, “may
not be so baseless as you regard it. The entire series of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>the heathen mythology has been of old, and still is, in
Germany, regarded as a mere mystical delineation of the
phenomena of nature. The elements are said to have
suggested the nature of the gods and their origin; the
specific phenomena of nature may have suggested the
various forms under which the divine race appears and
acts. It was a very common practice among the astronomers
of the days of Galileo, and even to a later period,
to conceal their discoveries in enigmas. May we not,
with some little appearance of reason, regard the fables
of our ancestors, the knights, the dragons, the giants,
the magicians and their followers, as in some respect an
esoteric teaching of the philosophy of physics, a mystical
setting forth of natural phenomena?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The love of our Anglo-Saxon ancestors for philosophical
enigmas, as they may be called, was undoubtedly
very great,” rejoined Lathom. “I remember one
given by Mr. Wright, in his introduction to Anglo-Saxon
literature. It was in these words:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c016'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘I saw tread over the turf</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Ten in all,</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Six brothers</div>
      <div class='line'>And their sister with them,</div>
      <div class='line'>They had a living soul:</div>
      <div class='line'>They hanged their skins,</div>
      <div class='line'>Openly and manifestly,</div>
      <div class='line'>On the wall of the hall:</div>
      <div class='line'>To any one of them all</div>
      <div class='line'>It was none the worse,</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor his side the sorer:</div>
      <div class='line'>Although they should thus,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Bereaved of covering,</div>
      <div class='line'>And awakened by the might</div>

      <div class='line in4'>Left their ornaments,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Lying in their track,</div>
      <div class='line'>To depart over the earth.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“I shall not attempt to guess such an enigma,” said
Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Its solution is the butterfly; the various transformations
through which it passes from the grub until it
rises with its beautiful wings, are intended to be described.
But come, as we are on enigmas, what say you
to this: ‘We are a family of seventeen, all sisters; six
others claim to belong to our race, but we account them
illegitimate. We are born of iron, or of the feather that
bears the bird heavenward; by iron we die. Our fathers
were three brothers, our mother’s nature is uncertain.
We teach him who desires to learn, and quickly
and silently give words to him who requires them of
us.’”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I see the solution,” said Herbert, “but yet cannot
work it out; it is, doubtless, the alphabet, in that day
confined to seventeen true and six false letters; what
puzzles me is the iron, and the natures of the mother
and the father.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The iron,” said Lathom, “is the style used in writing;
the sharp point for marking, and the broad end to
rub out with; the uncertainty of the mother’s race
arises from the pen being either of reed, or quill, or
even of iron; the three brothers are the thumb and two
fingers employed in writing.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The ‘uncertain mother’ is peculiarly applicable
to these times,” said Thompson, with a smile, “when
you may vary your pen from goose to swan, and from
swan to crow; or choose between steel pens of every
size and shape, and delicate nibs of gold tipped with
rubies.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Come, we must leave our theories and enigmas, and
return to our old story-tellers,” said Herbert. “What
tale is in preparation for us?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“A little more demonology, as we have it in the
story of</p>

  <div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“CELESTINUS AND THE MILLER’S HORSE.”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Alexander had an only son, named Celestinus,
who was very dear to him; desirous
of having him well instructed, he sent for
a certain sage, and proffered his son to him
for a pupil, promising a bountiful remuneration
for his labor. The sage agreed, and took
the boy home with him. Celestinus was a
diligent scholar, and made great and satisfactory
progress under the tuition of the philosopher.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, as the tutor and pupil were walking
together through a meadow, their attention was
directed to a horse grievously afflicted with the
mange. He lay on the ground in the middle of
the field, and on either side of him two sheep
were feeding, tied together by a rope which
chanced to hang over the horse’s back; irritated
by the rubbing of the cord, the poor horse rose,
and naturally drew with him the two sheep.
The weight of the sheep made the rope press
more and more upon his poor back, and galled
him dreadfully. Unable to endure the pain,
the horse ran towards his master’s home; the
faster he ran, the more the sheep knocked
against his flanks, and by their weight ground
the cord into the sores on his back; with every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>struggle of the horse and his living burdens, the
cord sank deeper into the wound.</p>

<p class='c007'>On went the horse maddened with pain; at
last he reached the hut of his master, the miller,
and dashed in with his burdens through the
open door. No one was within, but a fire of
logs burned brightly on the hearth; plunging
and striking with his hoofs, the horse scattered
the burning logs about the house; the flames
caught the building, and soon surrounded the
poor animal. Unable to move from the terror
of the flames, there died the poor horse and the
unlucky sheep, amid the ruins of the miller’s hut.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My son,” said the tutor, when from afar he
saw the end of the accident, “you have seen the
beginning, the middle, and the end of this incident;
when you return to your study, make me
some verses upon it, and show me wherefore
the house was burned. If you fail, beware of
the punishment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was all in vain that Celestinus tried to coin
a verse or two on such a curious subject. He
felt more than usually unpoetical; and as for
assigning a cause for the fire, he so puzzled
himself with his own arguments, as at last to
begin to doubt whether there was any cause at
all. At length he left his room, and tried what
a walk would do towards making him able to
poetize.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“My son,” said a venerable-looking man that
met him on his solitary ramble, “what makes
you so sorrowful?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pray do not trouble yourself,” replied the
youth; “it is quite useless to tell you of my
trouble; you cannot help me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, but my son—how can we decide until
we hear the cause?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, then, good father, I have got to make
some verses on a mangy horse and two sheep,
and I do not know how.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And to decide wherefore the hut, the horse,
and the sheep were burnt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, father, how do you know that?” exclaimed
Celestinus.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Though human to look at, I am not of this
world,” replied the old man; “come, make a
contract with me, henceforth to serve me, and
care not for your master; and I will make you
such a copy of verses as never were yet seen.
Come, choose; you know the alternative—the
philosopher flogs sharply.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Celestinus hesitated a long time, but at last,
through fear, he agreed to the Devil’s proposal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, then, my son,” said the Devil, “write
what I tell you. Are you ready to begin?”</p>

      <div class='line in2'>Is quicken’d with the pain.</div>

      <div class='line'>He minds not bolts, nor bars, nor logs</div>

      <div class='line in2'>Nor roasted both his sheep.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Delighted with the verses, Celestinus hastened
to his master on his return home. The
philosopher read them with astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Boy,” said he, “whence did you steal these
verses?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did not steal them, sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, come, boy—they are clearly not your
own; tell me who made them for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I dare not, master,” replied the boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dare not, why dare not? Come boy, tell
me the truth, or abide a worse punishment
than would have awaited you had you not
brought me any verses.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Terrified at his master’s threats, Celestinus
revealed his interview with the Devil in a human
form, and his contract of service with him.
Deeply grieved at the occurrence, the preceptor
ceased not to talk with his pupil, until he had
persuaded him, humbly and heartily, on his
knees, to confess to God his grievous sin in
his compact with the Devil. His confederacy
with the Evil One thus renounced, Celestinus
became a good and holy man, and, after a well-spent
life, resigned his soul to God.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Pray, Lathom, what moral did your old monk intend
to draw from this diabolical poetry?” asked Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“His application is very recondite; the preceptor is a
prelate of the Church; the mangy horse, a sinner covered
with sins; the two sheep represent two preachers bound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>by the cord of charity; the miller’s house is the world,
and the fire, detraction. I must admit that the application,
in this case, is far less valuable or intelligible
than the story itself.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In an old book of moral advice,” said Herbert, “I
found a description of three madmen, that reminded me
much of the five kinds described by St. Peter, as related
by your old writer. The first carried a fagot of wood,
and because it was already too heavy for him, he added
more wood to it, in the hopes of thereby making it
lighter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And he,” rejoined Lathom, “was a sinner, daily adding
new sins to old, because unable to bear the weight
of his original errors.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The very same. The second madman drew water
from a deep well with a sieve; his labor was incessant,
and his progress just as slow. Can you explain the nature
of his sin?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I can read the explanation,” rejoined Lathom, “for I
have this moment found out the source of your extract
in my old monk’s book. This madman was the man who
does good, but does it sinfully, and therefore it is of no
benefit. The third madman was far worse: he carried
a beam in his chariot; and wishing to enter his court-yard,
and finding the gate so narrow that it would not
admit the beam, he whipped his horse until it tumbled
both itself and its master into a deep well. The beam
was worldly vanities, with which their possessor sought
to enter into heaven, but by which he was cast down into
hell.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The belief in witchcraft,” began Herbert, “is very
well illustrated by a late publication of the Camden
Society of London.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, nay, Reginald, no more of witches now,” rejoined
Lathom; “the subject deserves far more time,
attention, and illustration than we can now afford it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>and must be adjourned for the present. Let me conclude
this evening with the tale of</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“THE EMPEROR CONRAD AND THE COUNT’S SON.”</h3>

<p class='c014'>During the reign of the Emperor Conrad,
there lived a certain count of the name
of Leopold, who had risen to high commands
by his bravery and his knowledge. Every one
regarded the count with favor, and loved him
for his kindness to suitors, and his prowess
against the enemies of the emperor. Conrad
alone looked on his servant with an evil eye;
for he envied his reputation, and would have
taken to himself the glories he had acquired,
and ascribed to himself those victories which
Leopold had won.</p>

<p class='c007'>The count, unable to endure the evil looks
and hard words of the emperor, and fearful that
in time his present anger would be turned into
bitter hatred, suddenly left the court of Rome,
and fled with his wife into the forest of the
Apennines. There he toiled all day, and labored
diligently to support himself and his
spouse. There he knew not what the fear
of impending evil was; he had no one to
envy him, no one to covet his position or his
property.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a bright sunny day, and the meridian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>sun glared with unwonted fierceness, even
through the thick trees of the forest, and
rendered the air close and heavy from lack
of a breeze to move even the highest leaves
of the loftiest pines. The emperor pursued the
chase with ardor; urged on by the exhilarating
cry of the hounds, he thought not of the denseness
of the forest, or the tangled nature of its
winding ways, until at last, tired and thirsty, he
checked his horse in a dark, close glade, and
looked around for some hut where he might
obtain rest and refreshment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many were the paths which the emperor and
his attendants followed before they reached the
cottage where Leopold lived in solitude; the
count recognized the sovereign, but Conrad
knew not his old servant, nor was he recognized
by any of the hunting train; refreshments, such
as the homely store could furnish, were soon
placed before the emperor. It was now nigh to
evening; already the glades of the forest were
growing dark, and the devious paths more and
more difficult to track out, even to the experienced
eye of a woodman. It was useless to
attempt to escape from the forest before the
next morning. The attendants soon formed for
themselves sylvan beds on the soft grass, and
beneath the broad-spreading trees, their cloaks
for coverlids, and the green mossy grass for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>their beds. The emperor fared better. One
low tressel bed Leopold had in the lower room
of his hut; this he resigned to the emperor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fatigued with his hard day’s riding, Conrad
soon fell asleep; how long he slept he knew
not; but when all was dark and still, both
within and without the hut, a voice broke upon
his ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take—take—take,” said the voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Conrad rose and listened. “What,” said he
to himself, as he thought on the words, “what
am I to take? Take—take—take: what can
the voice mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he reflected on the singularity of the
words, the emperor again fell asleep; again a
voice awoke him from his slumbers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Restore—restore—restore,” said the mysterious
voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What means all this mystery?” exclaimed
the emperor. “First I was to take, take, take,
and there is nothing for me to take; and now I
am to restore. What can I restore, when I have
taken nothing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the emperor slept, and again the voice
seemed to speak to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fly—fly—fly,” said the voice this time, “for
a child is now born, who shall become thy son-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was early dawn when Conrad heard the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>voice the third time. He immediately arose,
and inquired of his squires if they had heard a
noise, and what had happened in the night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Naught,” replied they, “my lord, but that
a son was born to the poor woodman whilst you
slept.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hah!” exclaimed Conrad, “a son—to mount—to
horse—we will away.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The emperor and his train had hardly found
their way out of the wood, when Conrad called
two of his knights to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go,” said he, “to the woodman’s hut, take
away the new-born child, kill it; and bring its
heart to me, that I may know that you have
performed my commands.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With sorrowful hearts the two knights returned
towards the woodman’s cottage. The
babe was nestled in its mother’s breast, and
smiled on them as they seized it. Vain was the
resistance of its mother, for she was alone;
Leopold had gone into the wood, to his daily
labor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I cannot strike the poor babe,” said one
knight to the other, as they left the hut in the
forest, “do you play the butcher.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not I,” replied the other; “I can strike
down my adversary in fair fight, but not this
poor babe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this moment a hare sprang across the path
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>so close to the foremost of the knights, that he
raised his hunting pole and struck it down.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Comrade,” said the other knight, “I perceive
how we may make the emperor believe
that we have obeyed his commands, and yet not
take this poor babe’s life—open the hare, take
out its heart. As for the babe, we will place it
on yonder high branch, where the wild beasts
cannot get at it, until we have done our message
to the emperor, then will I return and take this
poor babe to my home, for I am childless.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaving the babe, the two knights went on
their message to the emperor; but before they
could return, a good duke rode by the tree
where the babe was, and took compassion on it,
and carried the child to his own house, where it
was nurtured as his own son. As for the child,
he grew up a man of fine form, the joy of his
adopted parents, eloquent in speech, and a
general favorite at the emperor’s court. For a
time, Conrad was as pleased with the attainments
of the young Henry, as he had been with
those of his poor father; but time brought with
it envy, and he soon hated the youth, as he had
before the unfortunate count. A dreadful suspicion
haunted Conrad’s mind that he had been
deceived by his knights, and that the youthful
favorite of the people was the woodman’s child,
against whom he had been warned by the secret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>voice. The most cruel thoughts entered his
mind, and he determined, this time, not to be
deceived by his agents.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Henry,” said he to the young count, “I
have a letter of the utmost importance that I
wish to be delivered to my wife; to you I
commit it, for you I can trust; haste, then, prepare
for your journey, whilst I write the letter.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry retired to his apartments to prepare
for his ride  he chose his best riding suit, and
his strongest horse, desirous in every way to do
honor to the emperor’s mission. Conrad went
to his private room to prepare the letter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As soon as this letter reaches you,” he
wrote, “I command you to cause the bearer
thereof to be put to death. See that this be
done, as you value my love.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Henry received the letter, and prepared to
commence his journey. As it happened, his
horse cast one of its shoes, and he was compelled
to wait until another could be forged.
Unwilling that the emperor should know of the
delay, the young man wandered into the royal
chapel, and seating himself in one of the royal
stalls, fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a prying, crafty priest in the
chapel, who had heard the message given to
the young count, and wished very much to discover
the secret of the message. Seeing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>young man asleep, he silently approached the
youth, and extracting the letter from the little
silken bag in which it was enclosed, opened its
folds, and read, with astonishment, the proposed
wickedness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Poor youth,” murmured the priest, “thou
little thinkest on what errand you are riding.
But, come, I will deceive this cruel emperor,”
continued he, as he erased the passage in which
Henry’s death was commanded, and inserted
these words: “Give him our daughter in
marriage.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The letter altered and replaced, his horse reshod,
Henry set out on his journey, and soon
arrived at the city where the queen dwelt. Presenting
his letter to the queen, he was greatly
surprised when she hailed him as her son-in-law,
by virtue of the royal commands, and bade
the priests and nobles of her court to assist in
rendering the celebration of the nuptials as
gorgeous as befitted the occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was in vain that Conrad raged against the
deceit thus practised on him; one by one the
wonderful facts of the young man’s deliverance
were revealed to him, and he could not but
recognize in them all the hand of a protecting
Providence. Deeply penitent for his many
offences against God and man, he confirmed
the marriage of his daughter, recalled the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>count from his forest hut, and proclaimed the
young Henry heir to his empire.</p>

<p class='c015'>“There is a great family likeness between this tale of
yours, and the German story of The Giant with the Golden
Hair.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In what respect?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“In the manner in which the fortunate youth obtains
the princess as his wife. In that legend, a king discovers
the babe after a manner very similar to that in
which Henry is found by Conrad, and—warned that the
child is to be his son-in-law—he sends him on a message
to his queen, with a letter of the same import as in your
tale. Fatigued with his journey, the youth arrived at a
robber’s cottage, falls asleep, and during his rest the
thieves alter the letter, as the priest does that borne by
Henry. The effect is, of course, similar.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“But what of the golden-haired giant?” asked Herbert.</p>

<p class='c012'>“He does not appear until the second part of the
legend, and this is doubtless added on from some other
tradition. You will find the whole story in Grimm’s
most amusing collection of German popular stories.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“With this tale, then, we conclude our evening’s
amusement.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I am afraid it must be so, Herbert,” rejoined Lathom;
“I should not like to be left without material for to-morrow,
our last meeting; and between this and then
I am unable to prepare any more tales.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“I have been very much surprised at the almost entire

<p class='c012'>“Oh, I will answer for Reginald; pray leave Miss

<p class='c012'>Here begins the tale of</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>THE KNIGHT AND THE THREE QUESTIONS.</h3>

<p class='c014'>A certain emperor had a very beautiful,
but wilful daughter, and he much wished
to marry her, for she was his heir, but to all his
wishes she was deaf. At last she agreed to
marry that person who should answer succinctly
these three questions. The first question was:
“What is the length, breadth, and depth of the
four elements?” The second required a means
of changing the north wind; and the third demanded
by what means fire might be carried to
the bosom without injury to the person.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many and many were the nobles, knights,
and princes that endeavored to answer the
princess’s questions. It was all in vain: some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>answered one, some another, but no one resolved
all three, and each reserved his secret
from his competitor, in the hopes of another
and more successful trial. The emperor began
to grow angry with his daughter, but she still
persisted in her intentions, and her father did
not like to compel her. At length, after many
years, came a soldier from a foreign land, and
when he heard of the questions of the princess,
he volunteered for the trial. On the appointed
day, the soldier entered the court of the palace
accompanied by one attendant, who led an extremely
fiery horse by the bridle. The king
descended to the gate of the inner court-yard,
and demanded the soldier’s wishes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I come, my lord, to win thy daughter, by
rightly answering her three questions; I pray
thee propose them to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Right willingly,” rejoined the emperor.
“If thou succeedest, my daughter and the
succession to my throne are thine; but mark
me, if thou failest, a sound whipping awaits
thee as an impudent adventurer. Shall I propose
the questions?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even so, my lord—I am ready; a crown
and a wife, or the whipping-post.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me, then, succinctly, how many feet
there are in the length, breadth, and depth of
the elements.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“Launcelot,” said the soldier to his servant,
“give the horse to a groom, and lie down on
the ground.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The servant obeyed his master’s orders, and
the soldier carefully measured his length, his
breadth, and the thickness of his body.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” said the soldier, as soon as the
measuring was complete, “the length of the
elements is scarcely seven feet, the breadth is
nearly three, and the depth does not exceed
one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How mean you, sir; what has this to do
with the elements?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” rejoined the soldier, “man is
made of the four elements; I have given you
the measure of man, and therefore of those
parts of which he is composed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have answered well, sir soldier; now
resolve this difficulty—how can the north wind
be changed?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Launcelot, bring up Niger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The servant brought up the horse at his master’s
command, and the soldier placed it with
its head to the north; after a few minutes he
administered to it a potion, and at the same
moment turned its head to the east; the horse
that before had breathed fiercely now became
quiet, and its breathing was soft and quiet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“See, my lord, the wind is changed.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“How, sir soldier?” asked the emperor,
“What has this to do with the wind?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” rejoined the soldier, “who knows
not that the life of every animal is in its breath,
and that breath is air? When my horse looked
northward, he breathed fiercely and snorted excessively.
Lo, I gave him a potion and turned
his head to the east, and now the same breath
comes softly and quietly, for the wind is
changed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well done—well done, soldier! for these
two answers thou shalt escape the whipping-post.
Now resolve me this difficulty: How can
fire be carried in the bosom without injury to
the person?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look and see, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words, the soldier stooped towards
a fire that burned in the court-yard, and
hastily seizing some of the burning wood,
placed it in his bosom. Every one expected to
see him injured, but after the fire had burned
out the soldier threw the wood from his breast
and there was neither scar nor burn on his breast.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well hast thou performed thy task, O soldier,”
said the king. “My daughter is thine
according to promise—the inheritance of my
kingdom is also thine and hers; now tell me
the secret whereby thou didst prevent the fire
from burning thee.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“This stone is the talisman,” replied the soldier,
showing a small bright stone that he
carried in his right hand. “Whosoever bears
this about him shall be able to resist the hottest
fire that man can light.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Loaded with riches and honors, the soldier
married the princess, and they succeeded to the
throne and the wealth of her father.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your princess, Lathom, seems to have been one of
those young ladies, who never dream that husbands and
wives are born for each other, but regard the former as
especially provided for the benefit of the latter.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I suspect the old monk, Thompson, thought very
little about love matters, but rather looked to the appropriateness
of his story for a religious application.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Exactly so, Herbert,” remarked Lathom, “the moral
is decidedly the best part of this tale. The emperor is
our Saviour; the daughter, the human soul. Measuring
the elements, is typical of subduing the lust of the flesh.
The fiery horse is a sinner changed by repentance; and
the small bright stone, that conquers the power of fire,
is a true and lively faith in our Saviour, utterly subjugating
the fire of pride, luxury, and avarice.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What is the tale of the marriage by racing?” asked
Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Hardly worth relating at length.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Except as a hint to our poor friend Reginald.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The lady is to be won by no one who cannot outrun
her. After many failures, comes one called Abibas, a
poor, but shrewd fellow. Knowing the failings of the
young lady, he prepares a garland of roses, a beautiful
silken girdle, and a golden ball, on which was written,
‘whosoever plays with me, shall never be tired.’ The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>race begins, and the lady is just passing her competitor,
when he skilfully jerks the rose garland on to her head.
Attracted by the smell of the flowers, and despising the
slow pace of Abibas, the lady stops to admire, and Abibas
gets well ahead. She soon throws away the garland, and
is off again after her competitor; nearer and nearer she
comes, when Abibas slily drops the embroidered girdle
in her path. She stops—admires—takes it up, and again
loses ground. Again she throws away the tempting bait,
and renews the race; the distance between her and her
suitor is soon lessened, and the race draws towards its
end. As a last resource, he casts the golden ball before
her. She stops—reads the inscription—determines to
try it for a moment—goes on and on with her pleasure,
and is only awakened from her folly by the cries that
hail Abibas as the winner of the race and the lady.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“What makes you look so solemn, Herbert? Can you
not persuade the repudiating father in your case, to run
a race with you for the lady.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Tut-tut, Thompson; I was thinking whether any of
those persons who promote or sanction what the world
calls marriages of convenience, in which every one admits
that love, or identity of feelings, has nothing at all
to do, ever read the commencement of the exhortation in
the marriage service. Surely it can never occur to them,
that we are there told that marriage signifies unto us the
mystical union between our Saviour and his Church.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“It were charity to suppose they were ignorant,” replied
Lathom; “but let us leave these speculations; we
are by no means in a proper tone of mind for them, and
are more ready to laugh than to reason.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Let us then return to our sorcerers and witches,”
said Thompson.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Nay, rather let me demand your attention for a tale
of some length, but not less interest, and which combines
just sufficient magic in its incidents to satisfy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>Herbert’s love of the marvellous. I will read you the
story of</p>

<div class="section"></div>
<h3 class='c013'>“JONATHAN AND THE THREE TALISMANS.”</h3>

<p class='c014'>Darius was a wise and prudent king; he
had three sons whom he loved much, and
amongst whom he divided his possessions. To
the eldest he gave his kingdom; to the second,
his personal wealth; to the third, a ring, a necklace,
and a valuable carpet. These three gifts
were charmed. The ring rendered any one who
wore it beloved, and obtained for him whatsoever
he desired. The necklace, if worn on the
breast, enabled the wearer to realize every wish;
whilst the cloth had such virtue that whosoever
sat upon it, and thought where he would be carried,
found himself there almost before his
thought was expressed. These three precious
gifts the king conferred upon Jonathan, his
youngest son, to aid him in his studies; but his
mother retained them during the earlier years
of his youth; after a time his mother delivered
to him the ring.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jonathan,” she said, “take the first of thy
father’s bequests—this ring; guard it as a treasure.
So long as you wear it, every one shall
love you, and whatsoever you wish shall be obtained
by you; of one thing beware—an artful
woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>Jonathan, with many thanks and protestations,
took the ring. Its magic effects were soon
evident. Every one sought his society, and
every one loved him. Though he had neither
silver nor gold, house nor fields, he had but to
wish for them, and lo, one gave him fields, and
another houses, a third gold, a fourth merchandise.
Walking one day in the streets of Rome,
he met a lady so beautiful to look at that he could
not restrain himself from following her, and
eventually he had no happiness but in her society.
She loved Jonathan, and Jonathan loved her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dearest,” said the lady one day, as Jonathan
was enjoying her society, “how comes it
that you immediately obtain every thing you
but wish for, and yet the good king did not
leave thee his wealth, or his power?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is a secret, Subtilia; a secret that I may
not reveal, lest it lose its value.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And do you profess to love me, Jonathan,
and yet keep from me the secret of your power,
your wealth, and your life?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ask me not, dearest, for it may not be.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Farewell, then, Jonathan—thou lovest me
not—never more will I love thee again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, Subtilia, but thou canst not prevent
thyself loving me as long as I wear this ring.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, Jonathan, the secret, the secret! you
wear a magic ring.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“Fool that I was,” exclaimed Jonathan, “in
my haste I forgot my discretion; well, you know
my secret—be honest, and keep it yourself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You have not told me all the properties of
the ring; I must know all if thou wouldst have
it kept a secret.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Subtilia at length elicited the secret from her
lover. The source of his power once known to
her, the next object of her plans was to obtain
that power for herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thou art very wrong, Jonathan,” said she,
looking up into his face, with her dark black
eyes; “surely thou art wrong to wear so precious
a jewel on thy finger; some day, in the
hurry of your occupation, you will lose the ring,
and then your power is gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is some sense in what you say, Subtilia,”
replied Jonathan; “yet where shall I
place it in security?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me be its guardian, dearest,” said Subtilia,
with a look of deep affection. “No one
will seek such a treasure of me; and whensoever
you wish for it, it will be ready to your hand;
among the rest of my jewels it will be perfectly
secure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jonathan acceded to her request, and placed
the ring in her possession. For a time all went
well; the ring was safe, and ready to his use,
and the lady’s love did not decrease. One day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>when he came to visit her as usual, he found
Subtilia sitting on a couch, bathed in tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my dear, dear lord!” exclaimed she,
casting herself at his feet; “how can I dare to
approach my lord?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why this anxiety, this sorrow, Subtilia?”
said Jonathan, as he raised her from the ground,
and strove to kiss away her tears.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, my lord! pardon me—the ring,” ejaculated
Subtilia.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah! the ring—what of the ring?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is gone, my lord—stolen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone! how gone, woman?” rejoined
Jonathan, in anger.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, my good lord; this morning I went to
my jewel-box to take out such ornaments as
might best please my lord, and lo, the ring was
not there; and now where it is I know not.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Farewell, Subtilia—I am ruined.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words Jonathan left the lady. It
was all in vain that he searched everywhere for
the ring; it was of but a common form, and he
dared not to reveal its secret, as once known no
one would dream of resigning such a treasure.
In his distress he returned to his mother, and
told her all his misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My son,” said his lady mother, “did I not
warn thee of this very danger? by the subtlety
of this woman thou hast lost thy charmed jewel.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Receive now thy father’s second bequest—this
necklace; so long as you wear this on your breast,
every wish of yours shall be fulfilled; go in peace,
and, once more, beware of female subtlety.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Overjoyed with his new acquisition, and unable
to believe that Subtilia had deceived him
about the loss of the ring, Jonathan returned to
the city, and to the society of that fair but deceitful
lady. For a time his secret remained
within his own breast; at length, however, he
yielded to the blandishments of his lady-love,
and disclosed to her the source of his prosperity.
Long and subtle were the means by which Subtilia
gained the knowledge of the secret of the
necklace, and longer and more subtle the plans
by which she at last gained it to her own possession.
This too was lost, as the ring; and
Jonathan returned a second time to his mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My son,” said she, “these two times you
have fallen a victim to female subtlety, the ring
and the necklace are not lost; Subtilia has them
both, and if you would succeed, you must regain
them from her. Receive this, the third and last
bequest of your royal father; seated on this
carpet, you have but to wish to find yourself
forthwith in whatever place you desire; go in
peace, my son—for the third time, beware of
female subtlety.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will be revenged on this faithless woman,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>muttered Jonathan, as he entered Subtilia’s
house bearing the last bequest of Darius.
“Subtilia,” he said, “come, see the third bequest
of the good king: this splendid carpet—here
sit down with me on it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Subtilia was hardly seated on the carpet, ere
Jonathan wished that they were in a desert
place, far, far from the abode of man. His wish
was hardly complete before they were both in a
drear solitude, many hundreds of miles from a
human abode, and where wild beasts and deadly
serpents abounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Subtilia!” exclaimed Jonathan, “thou art
now in my power: restore the ring and the
necklace, or die by the mouths of beasts, or the
slow torture of famine; no human footstep
ever treads these solitudes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We perish together, Jonathan.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Delude not thyself so, false woman,” rejoined
Jonathan, in anger; “I have but to wish
myself away, and find my wish accomplished;
choose therefore—death, or the restoration of
the ring and the necklace.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have his secret,” muttered Subtilia to herself;
and then, with a most piteous voice, “my
dear lord, I pray thee give me time—but an
hour, or even less—before I decide.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As you wish; until the sun touches the top
of yonder pine tree, consider your choice.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Whilst the time was passing away, the heat
of the day seduced Jonathan into a slight sleep.
Subtilia saw the advantage; slowly, and softly,
she drew away the carpet from beneath him,
and as, awakened by her last efforts, he would
have regained the magic carpet, she wished
herself again at Rome, and passed from his
sight. He was alone in the desert, whilst
she revelled in every luxury that could be obtained
through the means of the three gifts of
his royal father.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jonathan meditated on his situation, and
upbraided himself for his own foolishness:
whether to bend his steps from that dreadful
wilderness he knew not, but committing himself
by prayer to God’s especial protection, he
followed a narrow path, and at length reached
the banks of a large river. The river was not
deep, and Jonathan essayed to pass it. Though
the water was so hot that it burnt the flesh off
his bones, he persevered, and at length reached
the opposite bank. He essayed to taste of the
stream, but it was sore bitter, and burned the
roof of his mouth as he drank of it. Astonished
at the properties of the river, Jonathan
placed a small quantity of it in a glass vessel,
and proceeded, with great pain, on his journey.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hunger soon succeeded to thirst, and the solitary
wanderer wist not how to assuage his bitter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>craving. As he wandered on, limping with
pain, he suddenly cast his eyes on a fair and
tempting tree, abounding in fruit of a rich and
golden hue. Without one thought of thanks to
God, Jonathan limped to the tree, and plucked
eagerly of the fruit. The fair meal had hardly
concluded, ere he was a leper from head to
foot, the foul disease broke out over his body.
Weeping and mourning for his misfortunes, he
gathered of the hurtful fruit, and renewed his
miserable wanderings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another hour of painful travel brought Jonathan
to the bank of a troubled, turbid stream,
whose depth appeared unfathomable, and whose
waters were repugnant even to the thirsty man.
Careless of his life, with one prayer to God, the
wanderer stept into the river, unconscious of its
depth. It was shallow, and offered little resistance
to his passage, though its stream seemed
to roll onward with headlong violence. His
burnt flesh, too, came again in all its original
purity. Jonathan reached the bank, and on his
bended knees gave thanks to God for his great
kindness in relieving him from his pains. Of
this stream, also, he took a small vase full, as a
treasured medicine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still the wanderer continued his journey,
hungry and a leper. No tree on either side of
him gave any promise of sustenance, and he despaired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>of sustaining his fast-fleeting strength.
Anon he came to a low, crooked, cankerous-looking
bush, with two or three withered, and
apparently rotten, apples on one of its branches.
Desperate with hunger, he seized one of the
wretched fruits and ate it. His hunger was assuaged;
his leprosy was departed from him.
Strength, health, and a free spirit seemed
renewed in him, and plucking another of
the withered fruits, he went on his way rejoicing.</p>

<p class='c007'>By the virtue of that food he wandered on
without feeling hunger; by the virtue of that
water his flesh suffered not from his journey,
and he knew not what fatigue was. After many
days he neared the gates of a walled city, and
made as though he would have entered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ho! sir traveller,” said the gatekeeper,
“whence comest thou—what art thou—and
whither goest thou?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“From Rome, good porter—a physician—”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stay,” interrupted the porter; “a physician—you
are in good fortune—canst cure a
leprosy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can but try my skill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you succeed with this case your fortune
is made, friend; our king is ill of a leprosy.
Whoever will cure him will receive great rewards,
but death if he fails.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“I will undertake the cure,” replied Jonathan;
“lead me to the king.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jonathan entered the palace, and was led to
the chamber of the king, where lie lay on his
couch, wasted with disease, and covered from
head to foot with a leprosy of the most virulent
kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A physician, my lord the king,” said the
attendant, “who would try to cure your disease.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, another victim?” rejoined the royal
leper; “does he know the alternative?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My lord,” said Jonathan, “I am aware of
the terms, and accept them freely; by God’s
help I will cure my lord, or perish in the attempt.
I pray my lord the king to eat of this
fruit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What, this withered, rotten apple?” exclaimed
the king.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even this, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The king took the fruit of the second tree,
and ate it as Jonathan advised. In a moment
his leprosy began to disappear, and the pimples
to sink and become hardly visible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thou art, indeed, a physician,” exclaimed
the king; “the promised reward is thine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stay, my lord,” said Jonathan, “we must
restore the flesh to its original state.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With these words, he touched every mark on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>the king’s body with the water of the second
river, and the flesh returned fair and white as
before the leprosy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Blessed physician, thy reward is doubled;
stay, I pray thee, in our country.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nay, my lord, I may not. I must seek my
own land, and all I ask is that my lord will
divide the half of my reward amongst the poor
of this city.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon after this Jonathan sailed from this city
for Rome; arrived there, he circulated a report
that a great physician had arrived. Now it
happened that Subtilia, in despite of all the
talismans, lay grievously sick, and nigh unto
death. The report of the arrival of the great
physician comforted her, and she sent for Jonathan.
He knew her again, but she knew him
not, for he was greatly altered and disguised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Great master,” said she, in a faint voice, “I
die.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Death, lady, comes ever to those who confess
not their sins against God and man, and defraud
their friends; if thou hast done this my
help is vain, without confession and restoration.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then did Subtilia confess all her treachery
against Jonathan, and how she had deprived
him by her subtlety, of the three talismans, and
left him to die in a desert place.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>“Woman,” said Jonathan, “thy ill-used lover
yet lives, and is prosperous; the talismans must
be restored to him—where be they?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In yonder chest; here, take the keys, restore
them to Jonathan, and give me of your
medicine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take this fruit—drink of this water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mercy, mercy!” exclaimed Subtilia, “I am
a leper—the flesh is burning away from my
bones—I die—I die.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Subtilia, thou hast met with thy reward—thou
diest—and Jonathan is thy physician.”</p>

<p class='c007'>With one fearful look at Jonathan, and one
agonized scream, the wretched woman fell back
a corpse, her diseased flesh already mouldering
to destruction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jonathan regained his father’s bequests, and
returned to his mother; the whole kingdom rejoiced
at his return. Until his life’s end he remembered
the lessons he had learnt in his
prosperity and his poverty, and he lived and
died in peace with God and with man.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Your tale, of course, boasts of a moral?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Yes; a moral far from unreasonable. The Emperor
Darius is typical of our Saviour, as is generally the
case in these tales; and the queen-mother is the Church.
The two sons are the men of this world; the third son
typifies the good Christian. The lady, his great temptation
and source of all his evils, is the flesh. She first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>obtains from him the ring of faith, and after that deprives
him, by her devices, of the necklace of hope; and
in despite of these warnings, steals front him, at last, the
cloth of charity. The bitter water, that burneth away
the flesh from the bouts, is repentance, and the first
fruit is heartfelt remorse; the second river is repentance
before God, and the unpromising fruit represents the
deeds of faith, prayer, self-denial, and charity.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have left the leprous king and the ship still unexplained.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The former is but a type of a sinful man, the other
is intended to represent the Divine command, but the
application seems forced and inappropriate.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“You have another link between the East and West in
this tale,” remarked Herbert. “The talisman of the
magic cloth may be found in the ‘Arabian Nights,’ in
the story of Prince Ahmed, and the Fairy Pari Banou.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“All the three talismans proclaim the Eastern origin
of the story,” remarked Lathom; “and besides this, its
entire structure resembles the tale of Fortunatus, to
which few have hesitated to assign an Eastern origin.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Many of the incidents of your story are to be found
in the old German nursery tale of The Dwarf and the
Three Soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“Not unlikely; but the tale in question is so little
known to me that I cannot trace the likeness.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“The tale, in a few words, is this,” replied Thompson.
“Three poor soldiers obtain from a dwarf three gifts: a
cloak, a purse, and a horse—one and all equally useful in
promoting their worldly advantage. A crafty princess
steals all these gifts, and the soldiers are once more poor.
Driven by hunger, one of the three eats of an apple-tree
by the road-side, and forthwith his nose grows, not by
inches, but by miles. The friendly dwarf, in pity of his
misery, cures him by administering another kind of apple;
and the nose shrinks as quickly as it had grown.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>“Now comes the revenge on the princess. The old
soldier offers some of the fatal apples for sale; the
princess buys and eats; her nose grows without ceasing.
Under pretence of curing her, the old soldier, disguised
as a doctor, makes her nose grow more and more,
and at length, having terrified her into restoring the
dwarf’s gifts, kindly gives her a piece of the second kind
of apples, and cures her of the nasal protuberance.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“And now that we have concluded our criticisms,”
said Herbert, “let us give all due praise to the admirable
instruction contained in this last narrative.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“May we not extend our praise to all the tales?”</p>

<p class='c012'>“As critics, well intentioned towards the writers, and
especially towards this translation, we must not set much
store on our criticism. We need not, however, fear to
give our own opinions, and therefore I agree with you
that great praise may with reason be given to all the
tales we have heard, and to no one more than that with
which our last evening, I fear, must now conclude. One
thing I would ask you, Lathom; you spoke of the want
of the usual accessories in these old monks’ stories.
One or two slips have not escaped me; but unless you
have re-produced many of the tales, the credit of great
experience in writing fictions must be allowed to the
authors of the Gesta.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I do not mean to deny that I have re-written many of
these tales, and in some places introduced a little embroidery,
but nowhere have I done more than re-set the
old jewels, and put old pictures into new frames.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“This, then, is our last evening with the old story-tellers,”
said Thompson; “to-morrow Herbert and I are
off for a week of home, whilst you are left here to——”</p>

<p class='c012'>“To re-set some more old jewels, should these, through
your report, obtain favor and acceptance with my
friends.”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
